# **Book Contract (Working Draft)**

**Project:** *The Back Goes Backwards*
**Status:** Internal scope + intent document
**Purpose:** Govern structure, claims, exclusions, and resynthesis

---

## 1. Primary Purpose (Non-Negotiable)

This book exists to:

> **Establish mechanical stress–strain routing as a legitimate, under-recognized foundation of health and medicine, grounded in engineering principles, implemented through biological tissues, and relevant to prevention, degeneration, and recovery.**

The book argues that:

* living systems must obey mechanical constraints,
* health degrades when stress and strain are misrouted through tissues not designed to bear them,
* modern medicine has not fully integrated this reality,
* and doing so would materially improve how we understand injury, degeneration, and chronic dysfunction.

The book does **not** claim to replace medicine.
It argues for the recognition of a missing pillar.

## 2. Primary Audience (Who This Book Is *For*)

### **Primary Audience**

Professionally trained readers who are comfortable with anatomy, mechanics, and evidence-based reasoning, including:

* physicians (especially PM&R, orthopedics, sports medicine, pain medicine)
* physical therapists and rehabilitation specialists
* biomechanics researchers
* movement scientists
* medically literate engineers or physicists

This audience is the *center of gravity*.
If a section does not serve their understanding, it must justify its inclusion.

---

## 3. Secondary Audiences (Who May Benefit)

### **Secondary Audience A**

Movement professionals and teachers:

* yoga instructors
* martial arts practitioners
* athletic coaches
* somatic educators

For them, the book provides:

* mechanical grounding for practices they already use
* a non-mystical explanation of why certain methods work

### **Secondary Audience B**

Highly motivated general readers interested in:

* posture
* chronic pain
* movement
* long-term health

For them, the book provides:

* conceptual clarity
* practical orientation
* limited, conservative applications

The book is **not written at an entry-level**.
Accessibility comes through clarity, not simplification.

## 4. Core Claim Stack (What the Book Asserts)

The book asserts the following **in order**, with later claims depending on earlier ones:

1. **Mechanical reality is invariant**
   Gravity, load paths, stress, strain, and failure modes apply to biological tissue as surely as to engineered structures.

2. **Biology implements mechanics**
   Bones, joints, connective tissues, and muscles are the means by which living systems manage these forces.

3. **Health depends on correct routing of load**
   When stress and strain are carried by tissues designed to bear them, systems remain resilient.
   When they are misrouted, degeneration and dysfunction emerge.

4. **Medicine under-theorizes mechanical causality**
   While medicine treats mechanical consequences, it often lacks a unified framework for mechanical origins.

5. **Mechanical stress management deserves recognition as a medical foundation**
   Not a replacement for biochemical or genetic models, but a complementary and necessary pillar.

---

## 5. Explicit Inclusions (What Belongs in This Book)

The book may include:

* Engineering concepts applied to the body
  (stress/strain, thin shells, guy wires, load paths, failure modes)

* Anatomical and biomechanical reasoning
  (soft vs hard tissues, posterior vs anterior loading, compensation)

* Careful medical implications
  (degeneration, injury risk, resilience, prevention — with caveats)

* Historical movement systems **as observational encodings**
  (yoga, tai chi, martial arts)

* Light, illustrative models
  (tensegrity, axes, breath coordination)

* Practical takeaways
  (simple cues, conceptual reframing, non-prescriptive movement ideas)

---

## 6. Explicit Exclusions (What This Book Will *Not* Do)

This book will **not**:

* Present detailed disease-specific causal chains
  (e.g., “X causes Y disease”)

* Require belief in qi, prana, or energetic substances

* Offer a complete 4D tensegrity formalism

* Provide exhaustive bandha mechanics or advanced yogic techniques

* Claim diagnostic or therapeutic authority beyond scope

* Function as a self-help program or exercise manual

* Propose a total theory of health or consciousness

If a topic risks being “right in general but wrong in detail,” it is excluded.

---

## 7. Epistemic Boundaries (How Claims Are Framed)

All content must be clearly categorized as one of the following:

* **Mechanical invariant** (non-negotiable physics)
* **Biological implementation** (anatomy and tissue behavior)
* **Medical hypothesis** (plausible, justified, limited)
* **Historical observation** (what humans noticed)
* **Illustrative model** (useful, not required)

No section may blur these categories without explicitly saying so.

---

## 8. Tone Commitments

The book commits to being:

* conservative in claims
* precise in language
* explicit about limits
* non-dogmatic
* mechanically grounded
* respectful of medicine
* skeptical of overreach (including its own)

Persuasion comes from **coherence**, not certainty.

---

## 9. Success Criteria

The book succeeds if:

* a medically trained skeptic says
  *“I don’t agree with everything, but this deserves serious consideration.”*

* a movement professional says
  *“This explains what I’ve observed without mysticism.”*

* a general reader says
  *“I now understand my body differently, and more responsibly.”*
