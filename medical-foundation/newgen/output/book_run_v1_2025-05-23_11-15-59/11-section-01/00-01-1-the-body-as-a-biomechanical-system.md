### 1. The Body as a Biomechanical System

The human body functions as a complex, load-bearing structure governed by principles of biomechanics—an interconnected system where form and function are inseparable. Recognizing the body as a unified mechanical entity requires shifting away from viewing individual tissues or joints in isolation, toward understanding the dynamic interplay between its rigid and compliant components.

At the core of this model lies the relationship between hard tissues—bones, joints, ligaments—and soft tissues—muscles, fascia, vessels, and nerves. Hard tissues provide the structural skeleton, acting as the primary load-bearing framework. They establish the spatial orientation and serve as the anchor points for soft tissues, which envelop and connect these rigid elements. Soft tissues, in turn, distribute forces, provide elasticity, and facilitate movement, acting as the body's internal regulatory network.

This relationship is not static; it is a dynamic equilibrium. When load is applied—whether from gravity, movement, or external forces—the bones and joints must maintain alignment to distribute forces efficiently. Ligaments stabilize these rigid structures, ensuring that load paths remain coherent. Soft tissues adjust tension in response to these forces, either maintaining stability or permitting controlled mobility.

Disruption in this delicate balance—be it through poor posture, repetitive stress, or injury—alters load distribution. Bones may shift, joints become misaligned, and soft tissues adapt maladaptively, resulting in altered force vectors and increased strain. Over time, these changes can cascade, leading to tissue degeneration, pain, and systemic dysfunction.

Understanding the body as a biomechanical system emphasizes the importance of harmony between structure and soft tissue regulation. It underscores that health depends on the body's ability to maintain optimal load paths through coordinated alignment and tension. Dysfunction arises when this harmony falters, highlighting the necessity of interventions that restore mechanical coherence—whether through movement, manual therapy, or breath regulation—reestablishing the body's innate capacity for load management and systemic health.
