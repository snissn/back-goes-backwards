#### 3.4.3 Myofascial Trigger Points: Local Consequence, Global Origin

Myofascial trigger points are not discrete, self-contained lesions. They are the visible knots on a rope strained by uneven load—local signals of a system-wide breakdown in mechanical order. When the body’s kinetic chain loses coherence, force is no longer distributed along the robust, posterior axis. Instead, segments become isolated, and muscles in these regions are conscripted into compensatory overwork. The result: hypertonic bands, palpable tenderness, and the familiar, stubborn pain of a trigger point.

This is not a failure of the muscle itself, but a failure of global support. When posterior loading is lost—when the spine is permitted to collapse forward, or when the breath no longer expands and stabilizes the thoracic segment—adjacent muscles are forced to anchor movement in isolation. The classic upper trapezius or gluteal trigger point arises not from local misuse, but from the body’s attempt to patch gaps in the kinetic chain. The mechanical logic is unavoidable: where there is insufficient structural support, the system improvises with focal tension.

The clinical consequence is circular. Local pain leads to guarding; guarding further disrupts sequencing, amplifying the burden on already overloaded tissue. Attempts at local release—needling, massage, stretching—may provide temporary relief, but unless the underlying pattern of coordination is restored, the cycle persists. The true origin of the trigger point is upstream: in the loss of posterior chain engagement, the interruption of breath-driven expansion, and the breakdown of segmental timing.

Resolution, therefore, is not a matter of softening a knot, but of reestablishing the conditions in which knots do not form. Posterior loading and coordinated breath restore the body’s ability to transmit force along its central axis. As global support returns, the need for local compensation vanishes. The trigger point recedes, not as a target, but as a consequence of renewed mechanical order.
