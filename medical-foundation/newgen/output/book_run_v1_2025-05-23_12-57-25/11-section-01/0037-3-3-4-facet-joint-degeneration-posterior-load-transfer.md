#### 3.3.4 Facet Joint Degeneration: Posterior Load Transfer

Facet joints serve as the architectural hinges of the spine, guiding movement and distributing load across the vertebral column. In a healthy, posteriorly loaded system, intervertebral discs and facet joints collaborate—discs absorbing compressive force, facets stabilizing gliding and rotation. When disc height diminishes and the column collapses forward, the mechanical responsibility shifts. The posterior elements, especially the facet joints, are forced to bear loads they were not meant to sustain in isolation.

This transfer is not subtle. The articular cartilage, designed for intermittent, gliding contact, becomes a point of chronic compression and friction. The joint capsule thickens in a futile attempt to stabilize the now overburdened segment. Cartilage thins and erodes, exposing subchondral bone to direct stress. The clinical result is unmistakable: extension intolerance, local pain with backward bending, and the deep ache of posterior chain fatigue. The body signals its distress with every attempt to reclaim uprightness.

Mechanically, this process mirrors the fate of a bridge whose central supports have failed—load shunted to the edge, joints forced to lock, surfaces grinding under pressure they cannot dissipate. The facet joint’s degeneration is thus diagnostic of a fundamental disorder in load transmission. Instead of sharing force through the vertical axis and distributing it via resilient, hydrated discs, the system devolves into segmental overload and localized breakdown.

This is not simply a matter of wear and tear, but of pressure mismanagement. The breath-coordinated, posteriorly loaded spine maintains spacing and containment; when that architecture collapses, the facets are left as the final defense. Their degeneration marks not just local failure, but the collapse of systemic organization. Restoring health requires reestablishing posterior load, coordinated with breath, to reclaim the distributed, dynamic support the spine demands. Only then can the facet joints return to their intended role: guides, not shock absorbers.
