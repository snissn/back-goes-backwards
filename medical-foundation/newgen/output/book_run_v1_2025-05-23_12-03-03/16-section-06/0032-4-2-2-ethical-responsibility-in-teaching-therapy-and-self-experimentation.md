#### 4.2.2 Ethical Responsibility in Teaching, Therapy, and Self-Experimentation

Ethical responsibility in teaching, therapy, and self-experimentation is foundational to advancing biomechanical understanding without compromising safety or integrity. When engaging with the body's structural principles—posterior load, breath coordination, and three-dimensional alignment—practitioners must prioritize informed consent and transparency. Every intervention, instruction, or personal test should be rooted in a thorough understanding of potential risks and benefits, recognizing that even well-founded biomechanical principles can produce unintended effects if misapplied.

In clinical and instructional contexts, this means respecting the body's complexity as a tensegrity system—where small deviations in load or breath can cascade into dysfunction. Practitioners must ensure clients and students comprehend the rationale behind movements and adjustments, fostering informed participation rather than blind adherence. This transparency safeguards autonomy and empowers embodied awareness, which is essential when working with structures that underpin health and resilience.

Self-experimentation demands the same rigor. While personal inquiry can deepen understanding, it must be conducted with caution, humility, and a clear recognition of one's limits. Without rigorous self-monitoring and a grounding in biomechanical principles, experiments risk exacerbating existing dysfunctions or inducing new ones. Personal practice should always be informed by a solid foundation of anatomical and mechanical knowledge, with ongoing reflection and, when appropriate, consultation with qualified professionals.

Professional standards and peer accountability serve as guardrails, ensuring that teaching and therapeutic interventions are evidence-informed and ethically sound. This includes ongoing education, transparent documentation, and a commitment to do no harm. As the paradigm emphasizes the body's structural coherence—coordinated with breath and load—so too must practitioners uphold the integrity of that coherence in their work, avoiding shortcuts or dogmatic assertions that could jeopardize safety.

In sum, ethical responsibility is not merely a professional obligation but a core expression of respect for the body's inherent intelligence. It demands vigilance, humility, and a commitment to continuous learning—always prioritizing the safety and informed agency of those in our care, and recognizing that true biomechanical insight must be exercised with both curiosity and caution.
