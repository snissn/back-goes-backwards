## 1. The Body as a Biomechanical System

The body functions as an integrated mechanical system, where structure and function are inseparable within a dynamic load-bearing network. At its core, this system comprises two interdependent domains: the hard tissues—bones, joints, and ligaments—and the soft tissues—muscles, fascia, vessels, and nerves. These components operate in concert, forming a tensegrity-based architecture that distributes forces efficiently and maintains optimal alignment.

Bones and joints serve as the rigid framework, providing stability and defining the body's geometric boundaries. Ligaments act as tension elements, maintaining joint integrity and guiding movement trajectories. Soft tissues, including muscles and fascia, are the flexible, adaptable elements that generate movement, absorb shock, and adjust load distribution in response to external and internal demands. Vessels and nerves, embedded within this matrix, facilitate communication and metabolic exchange, ensuring the system remains responsive and resilient.

This relationship is not static but fluid, governed by the principles of biomechanics. When load is applied—whether from gravity, movement, or external forces—the tissues respond through a coordinated interplay. Proper alignment ensures that forces are channeled along the body's natural vectors, minimizing strain and preventing tissue breakdown. Conversely, misalignment or asymmetrical load leads to uneven stress distribution, overloading certain tissues while underutilizing others.

The soft tissues are not merely passive recipients of mechanical forces; they actively modulate the system's stability through tension and proprioception. Fascia, in particular, acts as a continuous, interconnected network that transmits mechanical information and stabilizes the body in real time. Together, these tissues form a tensegrity structure—an architecture where compression and tension elements balance to create a resilient, adaptable whole.

Understanding the body as a biomechanical system reveals that health depends on the harmonious interaction of these tissue domains. Disruption—be it a loss of joint congruence, fascial restriction, or muscular imbalance—disturbs force transmission and alignment. Such dysfunctions propagate through the network, impairing load distribution, reducing resilience, and setting the stage for pain, degeneration, and systemic decline.

This model emphasizes that the body's integrity hinges on the continuous, precise orchestration of its mechanical components. Restoring or maintaining this harmony requires attention to the structural relationships—how bones, soft tissues, and their tensions are aligned and loaded—since these are the foundational determinants of functional health and adaptive capacity.
