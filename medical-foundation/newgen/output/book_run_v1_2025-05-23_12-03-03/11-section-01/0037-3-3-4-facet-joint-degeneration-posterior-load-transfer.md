#### 3.3.4 Facet Joint Degeneration: Posterior Load Transfer

Facet joints are specialized synovial articulations that serve both as pivotal movement interfaces and as crucial load-sharing structures within the spinal column. Their design reflects an evolutionary balance: they are built to accommodate controlled motion while distributing mechanical forces across the posterior elements of the vertebrae. Under optimal conditions, they function in harmony with the intervertebral discs, ligaments, and musculature, forming a resilient, integrated system that maintains spinal stability and flexibility.

However, when the integrity of the anterior and central spinal components is compromised—most notably through disc collapse or misalignment—the facet joints are thrust into a primary role of load bearing. The intervertebral discs, acting as the body's shock absorbers, lose height and elasticity, shifting the burden posteriorly. This redistribution of force concentrates stress onto the facet joints, which are not inherently designed to bear such sustained, high-magnitude loads. Over time, this chronic overload triggers a cascade of degenerative changes.

Capsular tissues thicken as a maladaptive response to persistent strain, attempting to stabilize the joint but inadvertently restricting mobility. Cartilage surfaces, which normally facilitate smooth movement, begin to erode under the relentless mechanical friction and compressive forces. These erosive processes diminish the joint’s capacity for motion, leading to pain predominantly experienced during extension movements—when posterior load transfer is most pronounced. Patients often report extension intolerance and posterior chain fatigue, symptoms rooted in the joint’s attempt to cope with abnormal mechanical demands.

This degeneration is not merely a consequence of aging but a mechanical failure rooted in structural misalignment. When the posterior elements are overloaded due to anterior collapse, the facet joints become the central sites of wear. Their deterioration reflects a systemic shift: a failure of the body's load-sharing architecture, revealing how biomechanical dysfunction underpins degenerative disease. Restoring proper posterior load distribution—through alignment, posture, and breath-coordinated movement—becomes essential to halting or reversing this degenerative cascade. The health of the facet joints, therefore, hinges on maintaining balanced, posteriorly distributed forces that respect their design for movement, not sustained compression.
