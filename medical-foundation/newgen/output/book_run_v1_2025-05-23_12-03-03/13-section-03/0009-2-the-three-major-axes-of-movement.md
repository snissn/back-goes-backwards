## 2. The Three Major Axes of Movement

Human movement can be systematically understood through the lens of three principal axes: the rotational axis, the lateral axis, and the spinal (or sagittal) axis. Each axis represents a fundamental dimension of three-dimensional space, aligned with specific anatomical structures and movement patterns. Recognizing these axes provides a clear, biomechanical map for analyzing complex motion, diagnosing dysfunction, and designing targeted interventions that restore structural coherence.

The rotational axis runs vertically through the body, aligned with the spinal column and the center of the pelvis. Movements around this axis include twisting and turning—rotations of the torso, head, or limbs—facilitated by the vertebral facets, transverse processes, and associated musculature. These rotations are crucial for functional mobility, but when they are unbalanced or restricted, they generate shear forces and torsional stress that can cascade into broader structural dysfunction. Clinically, rotational imbalances often manifest as asymmetries in gait, thoracic stiffness, or neck tension. Addressing rotational dysfunction involves restoring the balanced engagement of the posterior chain and ensuring that breath and load are coordinated along this vertical axis, maintaining the integrity of the tensegrity system.

The lateral axis extends horizontally from side to side, passing through the body at the level of the pelvis and shoulders. Movements around this axis include lateral flexion, side bending, and tilting—actions mediated by the intercostal muscles, lateral spinal muscles, and the lateral aspects of the pelvis and hips. Lateral motion demands a balanced distribution of load through the posterior and lateral chains, with the breath flowing into the side bodies to maintain structural support. When lateral stability is compromised—such as in scoliosis or unilateral weakness—load distribution becomes asymmetric, increasing strain on the posterior chain and disrupting the body's capacity to regulate pressure and tension. Restoring lateral axis alignment involves reinforcing the posterior loading patterns, promoting symmetrical breath expansion, and realigning the soft tissue matrices to sustain upright resilience.

The spinal (or sagittal) axis runs anterior to posterior, traversing the body from the front through the center of the vertebral column, enabling flexion and extension movements. These actions are governed by the anterior and posterior musculature, the vertebral bodies, and the supportive ligaments. Proper movement along this axis—such as standing upright, arching, or bending forward—relies on a coherent posterior chain that maintains the body's center of mass over its base. Dysfunction here often manifests as hyperlordosis, kyphosis, or forward head posture, reflecting a breakdown in posterior loading and breath regulation. Effective intervention involves re-establishing posterior tension and load-bearing capacity, ensuring that the breath supports the posterior chain's elasticity and resilience, thus restoring the body's capacity for balanced flexion and extension.

Viewing movement through these three axes—rotational, lateral, and spinal—clarifies the body's inherent mechanical harmony. Each axis is interconnected: dysfunction along one often influences the others, disrupting the body's tensegrity and its ability to regulate pressure and load efficiently. Targeted interventions that respect these axes—coordinating breath with posterior loading and promoting balanced engagement—can restore structural coherence. This framework transforms complex motion analysis into a manageable, precise process, aligning clinical insight with the body's natural three-dimensional architecture, and emphasizing that health depends on maintaining harmony across all three axes in concert.
