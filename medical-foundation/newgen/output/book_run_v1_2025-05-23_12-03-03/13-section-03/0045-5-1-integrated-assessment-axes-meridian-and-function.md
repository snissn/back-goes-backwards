### 5.1 Integrated Assessment: Axes, Meridian, and Function

Integrated assessment begins with a precise understanding of how the body's three-dimensional axes and meridian pathways intersect to produce functional posture and movement. Each axis—longitudinal, sagittal, and transverse—serves as a fundamental vector along which load, tension, and motion are organized. Meridian pathways, rooted in empirical structural maps, serve as functional corridors that reflect and influence the body's mechanical coherence. To evaluate these systems effectively, one must approach posture and movement as a dynamic interplay of vectors and lines of force, with an eye toward identifying points of imbalance, restriction, or overload.

Start by establishing a baseline of axial alignment: is the longitudinal axis of the spine and skull maintained in a neutral, load-bearing line? Deviations—such as anterior pelvic tilt or asymmetrical spinal curves—indicate a shift in the primary vectors of load transmission. Then, examine the sagittal plane for anterior-posterior balance: does the body’s front-to-back load distribution follow the natural posterior chain? A compromised posterior chain manifests as forward head posture, rounded shoulders, or excessive lumbar flexion, disrupting the posterior loading principle central to structural integrity.

Transverse plane assessment involves rotational symmetry and the balance of torsional forces. Are the limbs and torso rotating freely and evenly, or is there a torsional restriction? Meridian mapping enhances this analysis: by overlaying traditional meridian pathways onto the anatomical axes, one can identify regions where the flow of tension and load is compromised. For example, a restriction along the liver meridian may correspond with a lateral deviation or a rotational imbalance in the torso, signaling a need for targeted intervention.

Functional testing integrates these observations: observe gait, reach, or balance to see how load and force are transmitted through the axes. Are movements smooth and symmetrical, or do they reveal compensations? Palpation and visual inspection of soft tissue tension, joint alignment, and muscle tone further clarify where structural and meridian-based imbalances reside.

This assessment is not static; it requires a fluid, iterative approach. By systematically analyzing the body's vectors and meridian pathways in relation to posture and movement, clinicians and movement professionals can identify the root mechanical disruptions—whether they stem from a misaligned axis, a restricted meridian, or a maladaptive load pattern. Recognizing these interconnected systems enables targeted, structural interventions that restore coherence: aligning the axes, freeing the meridian pathways, and re-establishing harmonious load transmission. 

In essence, integrated assessment becomes a map of the body's mechanical landscape—an ongoing dialogue between structure and function, guided by the principles of posterior loading, breath coordination, and multidimensional integrity. Only through this precise, systemic lens can the true potential for resilience, health, and embodied coherence be realized.
