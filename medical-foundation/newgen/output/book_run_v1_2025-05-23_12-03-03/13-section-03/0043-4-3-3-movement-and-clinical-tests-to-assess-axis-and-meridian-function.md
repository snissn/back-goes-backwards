#### 4.3.3 Movement and Clinical Tests to Assess Axis and Meridian Function

Assessing the integrity of each anatomical axis and its associated meridian requires precise, observation-based movement and clinical tests that illuminate the body's mechanical and energetic coherence. These assessments serve as functional probes—mechanical maps revealing where structural load, breath, and alignment are optimal or compromised.

Begin with the sagittal axis—front-to-back movement—by evaluating forward and backward flexion, extension, and their resistances. Clinically, observe the ability to maintain upright posture during gait, noting any excessive lumbar arch or collapse of the thoracic curve. Functional tests include controlled forward bends, where the ease or stiffness indicates posterior chain engagement, and backward extension movements, such as prone backbends, to assess the posterior musculature’s capacity to load posteriorly. A dominant or hyperactive anterior axis manifests as excessive forward bending, while restricted posterior movement suggests inadequate posterior loading and potential meridian imbalance.

Transition to the coronal axis—side-to-side motion—by examining lateral flexion and side-bending. Observe for asymmetries in shoulder height, pelvic tilt, or spinal curvature during lateral movements. Clinical tests include side-lying stretches, lateral reach assessments, and active lateral flexion against resistance. These reveal lateral load distribution and help identify which meridian pathways along this axis are under- or over-utilized, especially in the context of breath-driven stabilization.

The transverse axis—rotational movement—requires assessing spinal rotation and torsional flexibility. Tests involve seated or prone spinal twists, evaluating the capacity to rotate the thorax and pelvis independently and in concert. Restricted or uneven rotation indicates a breakdown in transverse load sharing and potential misalignment along the related meridian pathways. Observing the ease of rotation during active movement and passive palpation of segmental mobility provides insight into the integrity of the transverse axis.

Incorporate breath as a diagnostic lens: observe how breath patterns influence movement quality. Symmetrical, diaphragmatic breathing supports balanced load along all axes, while asymmetries or breath-holding reveal compensations or tensions that distort meridian function. Functional clinical tests—such as breath-hold during movement or controlled inhalation/exhalation patterns—can unmask hidden restrictions or overcompensations.

By integrating these movement assessments with palpation and visual observation, practitioners can map the body's mechanical and energetic landscape. Tracking changes over time—improvement in range, symmetry, and ease—confirms the restoration of axis and meridian coherence. These tests do not merely diagnose; they guide targeted interventions that recalibrate posterior loading, synchronize breath, and re-establish structural harmony along each dimension, aligning the body's form with its innate mechanical and energetic blueprint.
