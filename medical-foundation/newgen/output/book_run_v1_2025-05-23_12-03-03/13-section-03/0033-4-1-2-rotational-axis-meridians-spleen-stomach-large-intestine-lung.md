#### 4.1.2 Rotational Axis Meridians - Spleen, Stomach, Large Intestine, Lung

The meridians aligned with the body's rotational axis—specifically the Spleen, Stomach, Large Intestine, and Lung—serve as a fundamental network governing the body's capacity for torsional stability and dynamic balance. Anatomically, these meridians traverse the anterior and lateral aspects of the torso, ribs, and limbs, facilitating the rotational movements essential for maintaining posture, functional mobility, and resilience against torsional stresses.

From a biomechanical perspective, these meridians correspond to the tissues and fascial planes that enable and resist rotational loading. The Spleen and Stomach meridians, for example, run along the anterior midline and lateral trunk, influencing the torsional capacity of the abdominal wall and rib cage. They support the body's ability to twist and turn without losing alignment, acting as structural guides that coordinate the rotational vectors of the anterior chain.

The Large Intestine and Lung meridians, positioned along the lateral and posterior-lateral pathways, are intimately connected to the body's rotational axis through their influence on respiratory and fascial mechanics. The Lung meridian, running along the anterior arm and chest, modulates the thoracic cage’s rotational expansion, while the Large Intestine pathway influences the lateral fascial planes that allow for torsional flexibility.

Energetically, these meridians function as conduits for the body's rotational energy, integrating breath and load into a cohesive mechanical system. The Lung and Large Intestine channels, associated with respiratory rhythm, facilitate the subtle torsional adjustments required during inhalation and exhalation, aligning breath with rotational movement. The Spleen and Stomach meridians, linked to digestion and core stability, provide a foundation for the body's ability to generate and dissipate rotational forces—integrating visceral, fascial, and muscular components into a unified biomechanical axis.

Treating the body as a three-dimensional structure underscores the importance of understanding these meridians as vectors of rotational load. They enable the body to twist and turn in space, preserving the integrity of the axial skeleton and its surrounding tissues. When dysfunction occurs—such as restricted rotation, fascial tightness, or impaired breath—these meridians and their associated tissues become stiff or misaligned, disrupting the body’s rotational coherence.

Restoration of function involves precisely loading and mobilizing these pathways in a manner that respects their biomechanical roles. Forward-loading the anterior tissues, combined with breath-coordinated rotation, can restore the natural glide and load distribution along these meridians. Conversely, neglecting their rotational axis—by overemphasizing linear or anterior-posterior loading—can create torsional dissonance, leading to compensations, pain, and systemic instability.

Understanding these meridians as aligned with the rotational axis clarifies their role as both structural and energetic scaffolds. They form a biomechanical network that maintains the body's torsional integrity, integrating breath, load, and tissue plasticity into a resilient whole. Recognizing this allows clinicians and movement professionals to design targeted interventions that reestablish the body's natural rotational harmony, grounding traditional energetic maps in precise, mechanical principles.
