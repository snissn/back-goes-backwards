#### 4.2.1 How the 4D Model Explains Explosive Force and Soft Power

The 4D tensegrity model reveals that explosive force, exemplified in martial arts as fa-jing, and the resilient, spring-like resistance of peng, are not opposing qualities but interconnected expressions of a unified structural principle rooted in breath and global tension. At its core, the body functions as an integrated tensegrity system—where elements of compression and tension are balanced across the entire structure, enabling rapid, coordinated energy transfer.

Fa-jing, the focused, elastic release of force, emerges when the body harnesses stored tension within its tensegrity framework. When a practitioner initiates a movement, the breath acts as a mechanical catalyst, generating a wave of tension that propagates swiftly through the interconnected fascial and muscular networks. This tension, distributed via the posture’s structural vectors, accumulates in a specific region—often the hips, shoulders, or limbs—and then releases explosively. The release is not a sudden, isolated motion but a coordinated wave of energy that travels through the entire tensegrity system, culminating in a precise, powerful impulse.

Conversely, peng reflects the body's capacity for expansive, resilient resistance—an elastic, inflated state that absorbs and redistributes forces. Here, the breath sustains tension across the posterior chain and core, creating a spring-like quality. This resilience relies on the body’s ability to maintain a balanced tension network, where the breath’s rhythmic engagement keeps the structure taut yet adaptable. The body’s connective tissues function as a tensegrity lattice, storing potential energy during load and releasing it when needed, allowing the practitioner to resist external forces with soft, elastic power.

Both phenomena depend on the rapid transfer and modulation of tension—enabled by the body's tensegrity architecture—where breath functions as the dynamic control mechanism. In this view, a sudden fa-jing is a transient, high-velocity wave of tension traveling through a pre-loaded, breath-driven structure. Meanwhile, peng embodies a sustained, resilient state, maintained through steady, controlled tension facilitated by breath.

This model explains how these qualities are two sides of the same coin: explosive force and soft power are expressions of a body's capacity to regulate tension across its entire 4D tensegrity system. The body's structural coherence, maintained through coordinated breath and load, allows for swift energy release without disintegration, and resilient resistance without stiffness. Both rely on a fundamental principle—posterior loading, synchronized with breath—that creates a coherent, unified force vector capable of rapid, efficient transfer or absorption.

Thus, the 4D tensegrity model illuminates that the body’s power hinges on its ability to dynamically modulate tension, with breath as the central driver. Whether unleashing a sudden, explosive fa-jing or maintaining resilient peng, the underlying mechanism is a precise, whole-body orchestration of tension and release—fundamentally a mechanical dance choreographed by the breath within a structurally integrated tensegrity system.
