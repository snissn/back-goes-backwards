#### 1.2.2 Dynamic Overload on Rigid Structures

Repetitive or excessive force applied to rigid structures—bone, cartilage, and ligament—can initiate a cascade of microtrauma that accumulates silently over time. When biomechanical alignment is compromised, the body’s load pathways deviate from their optimal trajectories, forcing these tissues to bear forces they were not structurally designed to handle efficiently. Even submaximal, habitual stresses, if persistent, become a form of structural fatigue, gradually undermining the integrity of these tissues.

Bone, traditionally viewed as a static framework, is in fact a dynamic tissue that adapts to mechanical demands. Under prolonged overload, microfractures can develop—tiny disruptions in the crystalline lattice—initially imperceptible but cumulatively weakening the bone’s capacity to withstand further load. Cartilage, with its avascular nature, relies heavily on mechanical loading for nourishment and repair. Excessive or uneven pressure—often resulting from misalignment—accelerates cartilage degeneration, initiating microtears and matrix breakdown that impair load distribution and joint function.

Ligaments, which serve as the body's passive stabilizers, are particularly vulnerable to repetitive strain. Small microtears may occur with each cycle of loading, especially when the ligament is held in a stretched or strained position due to poor alignment. Over time, these microinjuries compromise ligament elasticity and tensile strength, reducing joint stability and increasing the likelihood of further injury.

This process is akin to the gradual wear on a structural cable: each small overload, seemingly insignificant in isolation, chips away at the tissue’s resilience. The body’s repair mechanisms attempt to adapt, but with persistent overload, microdamage outpaces regeneration. The result is a cumulative fatigue—an ongoing, silent erosion of structural integrity that predisposes the system to acute failure or chronic dysfunction.

Understanding that even habitual, submaximal forces can produce this microtrauma reframes how we view load and alignment. It underscores the importance of restoring and maintaining posterior load pathways—those aligned with the body's natural biomechanics—so that forces are transmitted efficiently, and tissues are shielded from unnecessary stress. When the structural system is properly loaded in a balanced, posteriorly-oriented manner, the risk of microtrauma diminishes, preserving tissue health and preventing the progression to degenerative states.
