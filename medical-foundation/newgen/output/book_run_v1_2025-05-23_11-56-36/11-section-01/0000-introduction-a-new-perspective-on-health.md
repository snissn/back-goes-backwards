## Introduction: A New Perspective on Health

Traditional models of health have long centered on biochemical and genetic factors, emphasizing molecular pathways, cellular function, and inherited predispositions. While these elements are undeniably integral to understanding disease, they often overlook a fundamental truth: the body’s core architecture and mechanical integrity form the foundation upon which all biological processes depend. Without a stable, aligned, and properly load-distributed structure, biochemical signals become distorted, tissues experience undue stress, and systemic resilience diminishes.

Viewing health solely through a biochemical lens is akin to examining a complex machine by only inspecting its fuel and circuitry, neglecting the physical framework that supports and transmits forces. The body is not merely a collection of chemical reactions but a dynamic, three-dimensional mechanical system—an integrated tensegrity structure—where bones, joints, muscles, fascia, and connective tissues interact continuously to maintain posture, facilitate movement, and regulate internal function.

This biomechanical perspective shifts the paradigm: alignment and force distribution are not superficial concerns but central determinants of health. When the posterior chain—posterior tissues aligned along the body's midline—is optimally loaded and balanced, it creates a resilient scaffold that supports all physiological systems. Conversely, misalignment, anterior loading, or uneven force transmission generate chronic stress, tissue degeneration, and systemic dysfunction.

Crucially, structural integrity influences biochemical signaling. Mechanical loading patterns modulate blood flow, lymphatic drainage, and neural activity, which in turn govern cellular health and systemic regulation. When the body’s architecture is compromised—due to habitual postures, injury, or neglect—the resulting biomechanical dysfunction acts as a hidden stressor, undermining resilience and paving pathways toward chronic disease.

Recognizing this interconnectedness demands a shift: health is not merely a matter of biochemistry but a state of structural harmony and mechanical coherence. By prioritizing alignment, force distribution, and the integrity of the body’s load-bearing systems, clinicians, movement professionals, and individuals can access a profoundly effective means of restoring resilience and preventing disease—one rooted in the body's innate capacity for structural regulation and mechanical self-correction.
