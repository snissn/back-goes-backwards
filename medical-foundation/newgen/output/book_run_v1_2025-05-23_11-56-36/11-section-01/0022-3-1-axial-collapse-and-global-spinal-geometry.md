### 3.1 Axial Collapse and Global Spinal Geometry

Axial collapse refers to the breakdown of the spine’s three-dimensional integrity, a fundamental shift that undermines the body's mechanical coherence. When the spine deviates laterally, collapses sagittally, or develops compensatory distortions, the body’s structural lattice—its tensegrity framework—loses its balanced tension and compression relationships. This collapse is not merely a matter of posture; it signifies a systemic failure that reverberates through the entire organism.

The spine’s geometry, when intact, functions as a resilient, load-sharing structure that aligns the body's axes of force and motion. Lateral deviations, such as scoliosis, distort the transverse plane, shifting the body's center of mass and disrupting the harmonic alignment of the posterior chain. Sagittal plane collapse—characterized by excessive flexion or extension—compromises the anterior-posterior balance, increasing compressive and tensile stresses in the soft tissues. Compensatory distortions—such as pelvic tilt or thoracic kyphosis—further distort the global shape, creating a cascade of mechanical inefficiencies.

This loss of geometric integrity impacts more than just posture. It impairs the body's ability to breathe optimally, as the thoracic cavity's shape becomes compromised, restricting rib motion and diaphragm function. Circulatory and lymphatic flow are affected by altered compression patterns, diminishing systemic efficiency. Proprioception, which relies on the precise mechanical feedback from aligned joints and soft tissues, becomes unreliable, impairing coordinated movement and increasing the risk of injury.

Fundamentally, axial collapse shifts the body's mechanical equilibrium from a balanced, tensegrity-based state to one of instability. The soft tissues—muscles, ligaments, fascia—are forced into defensive, often inefficient patterns of tension, leading to pain, fatigue, and further structural deterioration. Restoring the spine’s three-dimensional geometry, therefore, is not a matter of cosmetic correction but a clinical imperative to re-establish the body's integrated function. Rebuilding this geometric coherence reactivates the body’s inherent capacity for resilient, efficient movement and systemic health, rooted in the precise alignment of force vectors along all three axes.
