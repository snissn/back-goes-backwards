#### 3.1.2 Sagittal Plane Collapse: Kyphosis, Lordosis, and Flat Back Syndrome

The spine’s natural curves—cervical lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, and lumbar lordosis—form a dynamic sequence of arcs designed to distribute load, absorb shock, and coordinate movement with breath. When these arcs are distorted—whether by excessive forward flexion (hyperkyphosis), exaggerated backward extension (hyperlordosis), or the pathological straightening of flat back syndrome—the fundamental architecture of the axial skeleton is compromised.

Hyperkyphosis, often manifesting as an exaggerated thoracic curve, drives the thorax forward and compresses the anterior chest. This anterior collapse displaces the head and neck, shortens the posterior chain, and restricts posterior expansion on inhalation. The diaphragm is forced into a constrained, flattened position, diminishing its excursion and reducing intra-abdominal pressure regulation. The pelvic floor, deprived of a stable posterior anchor, loses its ability to counterbalance respiratory and postural loads. The result is a system that cannot organize pressure efficiently; breathing becomes shallow, the trunk loses its capacity to “open” along the posterior axis, and compensatory tension accumulates in the cervical spine, shoulders, and lumbar region.

Hyperlordosis, by contrast, exaggerates the lumbar and sometimes cervical curves, thrusting the pelvis and ribcage into anterior tilt. This loading pattern increases shear forces at the lumbosacral junction, strains the hip flexors, and overactivates the erector spinae. The abdominal wall is stretched and weakened, while the diaphragm’s dome is flattened, further compromising breath-driven pressure management. The posterior chain—gluteals, hamstrings, paraspinals—loses its capacity for coordinated, spring-like recoil. The spine becomes less a living column and more a bent lever, transmitting force inefficiently and predisposing the body to fatigue, joint irritation, and disc pathology.

Flat back syndrome, the pathological straightening or even reversal of the normal spinal curves, removes the spine’s architectural resilience altogether. Without the alternating arcs, the axial skeleton cannot “catch” or dissipate vertical load. Shock is transmitted directly through the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs, increasing the risk of microtrauma and degenerative change. The loss of curvature also impairs the ribcage’s ability to expand posteriorly on inhalation, locking the thoracic spine and inhibiting the cyclical, hinge-like opening that breath imparts to a healthy structure. The result is rigidity, restricted movement, and a system that must compensate by recruiting accessory muscles and increasing tension throughout the kinetic chain.

In each of these sagittal plane distortions, the spine forfeits its role as a dynamic, load-distributing tensegrity structure. Instead of transmitting force along a resilient posterior pathway, the system collapses into localized stress, impaired breath mechanics, and dysfunctional pressure gradients. The clinical consequences—chronic pain, impaired mobility, compromised organ function—are not the result of isolated curvature, but of a fundamental breakdown in the integration of posterior loading and breath. Restoring the natural arcs is not cosmetic; it is the mechanical precondition for structural coherence, efficient respiration, and global health.

As the next section will demonstrate, these distortions do not remain confined to the spine itself. The loss of optimal spinal geometry reverberates through the pelvis and cranial base, transforming local collapse into system-wide dysfunction.
