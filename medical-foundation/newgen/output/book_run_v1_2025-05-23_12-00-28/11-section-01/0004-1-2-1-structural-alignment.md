#### 1.2.1 Structural Alignment

Proper skeletal alignment functions as the fundamental framework for efficient force transmission within the body. When the bones and joints are aligned along their natural biomechanical axes, load pathways are optimized, allowing gravity, muscular forces, and external pressures to distribute evenly across tissues. This neutral alignment ensures that forces are transmitted through the skeleton’s designed leverages and vectors, minimizing unnecessary strain and preventing localized overload.

Deviations from this biomechanical neutrality—such as anterior pelvic tilt, scoliosis, or uneven limb lengths—disrupt these normal load pathways. Instead of force traveling smoothly through the intended channels, it becomes concentrated at points of misalignment. These stress concentrations act like localized pressure points, gradually weakening the bone, cartilage, or ligament structures through microtrauma. Over time, this uneven loading triggers a cascade of compensatory adjustments: muscles tighten or weaken, joints shift, and the kinetic chain reorganizes in an attempt to restore stability. Such adaptations are often maladaptive, leading to further misalignment and systemic dysfunction.

Misalignment propagates through the kinetic chain because the body seeks to maintain balance and function despite structural deviations. When one segment shifts, adjacent segments respond, creating a ripple effect that can extend from the foot to the cervical spine. This interconnected response transforms a localized biomechanical issue into a global pattern of compensatory strain, often manifesting as pain, restricted mobility, or degenerative changes elsewhere in the body. Recognizing and restoring alignment at the skeletal level is thus essential, not only to reestablish normal load pathways but also to prevent the cascade of dysfunction that arises from even subtle deviations.
