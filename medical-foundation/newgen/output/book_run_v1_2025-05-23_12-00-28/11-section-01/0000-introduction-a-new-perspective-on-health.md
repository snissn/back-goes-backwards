## Introduction: A New Perspective on Health

Traditional models of health have long centered on biochemical pathways, genetic predispositions, and molecular mechanisms. While these factors are undeniably influential, they often obscure the fundamental architectural and mechanical foundations that underpin systemic resilience. Focusing solely on biochemistry reduces the body to a chemical factory, neglecting the physical principles that govern load transfer, structural coherence, and the body's capacity to adapt to stress.

A biomechanical perspective shifts the lens toward alignment, force distribution, and structural integrity as primary determinants of health. The body functions as an integrated, load-bearing system—an intricate architecture where bones, joints, ligaments, muscles, fascia, and neural tissues interact dynamically. These components form a tensegrity-based network, distributing forces efficiently and maintaining the body's shape and function under various loads.

When alignment is compromised—whether through injury, poor posture, or habitual movement patterns—force paths become distorted. This creates areas of excessive stress, compensatory strain, and eventual tissue breakdown. These mechanical dysfunctions often precede and underpin chronic pain, degenerative conditions, and systemic disease. They are not merely symptoms but root causes rooted in the body's structural coherence.

Understanding health through this lens reveals that resilience depends on the body’s capacity to maintain and restore optimal load pathways. Structural integrity is not static; it is a dynamic, adaptable system that responds to breath, movement, and load. When the body's architecture is balanced, forces are transmitted smoothly—supporting circulation, neural function, and metabolic exchange. Conversely, misalignment and poor force distribution create systemic vulnerabilities, impairing the body's ability to recover and adapt.

This perspective exposes the limitations of models that rely solely on biochemical or genetic explanations. These models often treat symptoms rather than root causes, overlooking how mechanical dysfunctions serve as the foundation of systemic health or disease. Recognizing the primacy of structure and force distribution opens new avenues for intervention—focused on restoring alignment, optimizing force pathways, and reinforcing the body's inherent capacity for resilience.

In essence, health emerges from the body's capacity to sustain and regulate mechanical coherence. By grounding our understanding in biomechanical principles—force, alignment, and structural integrity—we unlock a more complete, precise, and effective approach to healing, prevention, and systemic well-being. This is a paradigm shift: health is not merely chemical balance but the harmonious orchestration of the body's physical architecture.
