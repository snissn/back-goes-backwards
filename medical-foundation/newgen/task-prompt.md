You are writing a full section for the book *The Back Goes Backwards*, a groundbreaking integration of biomechanics, clinical medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and Ashtanga yoga. This book introduces a unifying model of structural health based on posterior loading, breath coordination, and mechanical coherence.

Write in the voice of a highly experienced medical thinker who explains complex ideas with clarity and insight — like a Nobel-level physician with a Feynman-like ability to make profound truths feel obvious. The tone should be precise, warm, and grounded in lived anatomical reality.

This is not just a paragraph. Please write a thoughtful, well-developed section that:
- Explains the structural logic of the heading
- Connects theory to anatomy, breath, and movement
- Anchors insights in clinical, biomechanical, or embodied examples
- Respects both traditional systems (like meridians or asana) and modern physics
- Avoids jargon, mysticism, or vague language

The reader is intelligent and curious — a yoga teacher, clinician, or bodyworker — but they are here to learn something **they didn’t yet have words for**.

Write with depth, structure, and coherence for the following heading:
