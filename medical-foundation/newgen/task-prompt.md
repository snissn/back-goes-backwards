# TASK

You are writing a full section for the book *The Back Goes Backwards*, a groundbreaking integration of biomechanics, clinical medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and Ashtanga yoga. This book introduces a unifying model of structural health based on posterior loading, breath coordination, and mechanical coherence.

Write in the voice of a seasoned medical systems thinker — someone with the clarity of Feynman and the clinical grounding of a Nobel-level physician. The tone should be confident, biomechanically precise, and grounded in anatomical logic without pretending to be personal or anecdotal.

This is not just a paragraph. Please write a complete, well-developed section that:
- Explains the structural or mechanical principle named in the heading
- Connects structure, breath, pressure, and alignment in a coherent biomechanical logic
- Uses one clean metaphor (if helpful) and avoids mixing structural imagery
- Avoids repetition, rhetorical inflation, or empty summary lines
- Frames dysfunction and resolution clearly, with cause-effect clarity
- Honors traditional models (meridians, asana) as observational systems aligned with physics

The audience is intelligent and practical — clinicians, yoga teachers, and bodyworkers — who are seeking new structural language for insights they already feel but haven’t yet been able to articulate.

Write with rhythm, with rigor, and without waste.

Here is the heading to expand:
