  "1.3 Soft Tissue Dynamics: The Body\u2019s Tension Network": {
    "description": "Explores how soft tissues operate not as isolated anatomical parts, but as a unified, dynamic tension network\u2014balancing, adapting, and sometimes distorting load throughout the entire body. This section lays out the foundational tensegrity logic, clinical relevance, and the path from healthy adaptation to system-wide dysfunction.",
    "1.3.1 Introduction to the Tension Network": {
      "description": "Soft tissues\u2014muscles, fascia, nerves, and vessels\u2014form a continuous, integrated system of tension, not a collection of separate structures. This network orchestrates force transmission, posture, and adaptation in real time. When misalignment occurs, the tension network compensates globally, often masking underlying structural problems but at a systemic cost."
    },
    "1.3.2 Tensegrity and Baseline Tone": {
      "description": "The body's architecture is best modeled as a tensegrity system: bones are suspended by a matrix of soft tissue, allowing for both strength and flexibility. Baseline muscle and fascial tone preserve joint integrity and distribute load efficiently. When alignment is lost, the tensegrity system adapts, creating regions of overload and disuse that eventually alter the whole-body baseline."
    },
    "1.3.3 The Fascial Continuum and Internal Regulation": {
      "description": "Fascia is a continuous, adaptive tissue that maintains internal geometry, connects all regions, and regulates pressure and proprioception. Altered fascial tone\u2014due to chronic misalignment or overload\u2014leads to adhesions, impaired fluid and nerve flow, and changes in organ mobility, affecting both movement and systemic physiology."
    },
    "1.3.4 From Adaptation to Dysfunction: Systemic Implications": {
      "description": "The soft tissue system is inherently adaptive, but prolonged compensation can entrench new, dysfunctional baselines. Chronic mechanical strain increases energetic cost, distorts interoception, and disrupts physiology, often without overt injury. Over time, these adaptations propagate systemic dysfunction, setting the stage for pain, fatigue, and disease."
