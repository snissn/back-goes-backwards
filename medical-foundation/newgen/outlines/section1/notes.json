  "3. Clinical Conditions with Clear Biomechanical Origins": {
    "3.5 Structural Impingement and Space-Occupying Constraint": {
      "description": "Explores clinical syndromes where nerves, vessels, airways, or organs are physically compressed by postural collapse, fascial thickening, or developmental asymmetry. These conditions are defined not by tissue failure from within, but by mechanical constraint imposed by the external environment—often overlooked until vital pathways are disrupted.",
      "3.5.1 Thoracic Outlet Syndrome: Compression by Collapse": {
        "description": "A narrowing of the passage between the clavicle and first rib, resulting from postural collapse (e.g., forward head, kyphosis, scapular protraction). Compresses the brachial plexus or vascular structures, causing symptoms in the arm. Mechanical loss of space, not intrinsic nerve or vessel pathology, is often the root cause."
      },
      "3.5.2 Eagle Syndrome: Elongation, Space, and Sensitivity": {
        "description": "Elongation or calcification of the styloid process or ligament is innocuous in isolation, but becomes a problem in a context of postural crowding. Causes local nerve or artery irritation and craniofacial pain. Highlights how small bony anomalies become symptomatic when mechanical space is lost."
      },
      "3.5.3 Tongue-Tie and Hyoid Fascial Strain": {
        "description": "Restricted fascial glide beneath the tongue (ankyloglossia) transmits abnormal tension into the hyoid, jaw, and cervical tissues. This can influence airway patency, TMJ health, neck posture, and even thoracic outlet mechanics—illustrating how a localized tether has widespread mechanical effects."
      },
      "3.5.4 Wisdom Tooth Impaction and Mandibular Tension": {
        "description": "Impacted third molars are not just a dental issue, but act as mechanical obstacles in the craniofacial tension system. They disrupt masseter and pterygoid balance, affect mandibular alignment, and may propagate strain through the hyoid and neck in posturally vulnerable individuals."
      },
      "3.5.5 Deviated Septum and Midline Compression": {
        "description": "A deviated septum limits nasal airflow and alters upper airway pressure, but also signals midline asymmetry. It can reflect or cause cranial, jaw, or facial misalignment, leading to further imbalance in the fascial, muscular, and neural systems of the head and neck."
      }
    },
    "3.6 Kinetic Chain Distortion and Postural Compensation": {
      "description": "Describes how disruptions at any link in the body's kinetic chain trigger compensatory adaptations throughout the system. Highlights that posture and movement are governed by the integration of force, alignment, and tension across multiple segments—when one part falters, the consequences cascade, manifesting as global inefficiency, pain, or instability.",
      "3.6.1 Forward Head Posture: A Cascade from the Cranium Down": {
        "description": "Chronic forward positioning of the head disrupts axial alignment and multiplies load on the cervical spine. This pattern triggers widespread compensation: suboccipital compression, thoracic outlet narrowing, inhibited cervical flexors, jaw dysfunction, and altered balance—propagating tension and inefficiency from head to toe."
      },
      "3.6.2 Flat Feet and Arch Collapse: The Ground-Level Driver": {
        "description": "The collapse of the medial arch initiates a chain reaction: tibial rotation, knee valgus, hip misalignment, pelvic rotation, and altered spinal curves. These changes compromise gait and load distribution, often serving as the starting point for upstream pain and compensatory dysfunctions."
      },
      "3.6.3 Pelvic Torsion: The Rotational Core of Compensation": {
        "description": "Asymmetric rotation of the pelvis alters leg length, gait mechanics, and spinal alignment. This three-dimensional shift drives compensatory rotation and tilt throughout the trunk, shoulders, and even cranial base, embedding asymmetry into global movement and posture."
      },
      "3.6.4 Asymmetrical Behavior Patterns: The Invisible Driver": {
        "description": "Repetitive preferences—such as favoring one side when sitting, standing, or moving—reinforce neuromuscular and fascial bias. These unconscious habits compound structural distortions, perpetuating inefficiency, pain, and compensatory bracing throughout the kinetic chain."
      }
    },
  "4. Why Modern Health Problems Are Biomechanically Driven": {
    "description": "Examines how the prevalence of chronic pain, systemic inflammation, and declining vitality in modern society is rooted in the biomechanical stresses of contemporary life—especially prolonged inactivity, repetitive movement patterns, and postural distortion caused by technology. Provides a framework for understanding how these mechanical issues become drivers of systemic dysfunction, and outlines actionable, preventive strategies.",
    "4.1 Sedentary Behavior: The Impact of Prolonged Inactivity": {
      "description": "Explores how chronic sitting and inactivity distort spinal and pelvic alignment, weaken the posterior chain, and create tightness in the hip flexors—leading to back pain, hip dysfunction, impaired circulation, and reduced tissue vitality."
    },
    "4.2 Repetitive Stress: Gradual Wear and Tear": {
      "description": "Describes how repetitive motions at work or in daily life—such as typing, lifting, or manual labor—cause cumulative tissue damage, joint strain, and adaptive dysfunction, often developing insidiously until pain or injury emerges."
    },
    "4.3 Postural Imbalances: The Consequences of Technology Use": {
      "description": "Details how technology-driven habits like 'tech neck' and slouched posture place abnormal stress on the cervical spine, rib cage, and shoulders, resulting in chronic tension, reduced lung capacity, and widespread dysfunction."
    },
    "4.4 Systemic Consequences: Inflammation and Energy Inefficiency": {
      "description": "Connects local biomechanical issues to system-wide effects, explaining how chronic misalignment and muscle overuse provoke low-grade inflammation, energy inefficiency, fatigue, and increased risk for autoimmune and cardiovascular problems."
