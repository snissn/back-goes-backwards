# **Section 3 â€” Dimensional Analysis: Axes, Basis, and Meridian Mapping**

## **1. The Body as a Three-Dimensional Mechanical System**

### 1.1 Why 3D Modeling Matters

#### 1.1.1 The body is more than levers: introducing spatial complexity.

#### 1.1.2 How three axes simplify understanding complex movements.

### 1.2 Basis Functions and the Moment of Inertia

#### 1.2.1 What are basis functions? (Lay explanation, analogy to physics/engineering.)

#### 1.2.2 The moment of inertia: how the body resists rotation and movement.

#### 1.2.3 Why these concepts matter for joint and tissue health.

## **2. The Three Major Axes of Movement**

### 2.1 Rotational Axis (Twist and Torque)

#### 2.1.1 Anatomical structures: spine, pelvis, shoulders, forearms.

#### 2.1.2 Key movements: rotation, axial twist, pronation/supination.

#### 2.1.3 Mechanical importance: stability, force transmission, injury risk.

### 2.2 Lateral Axis (Side-to-Side/Balancing)

#### 2.2.1 Anatomical structures: hips, knees, ankles, ribcage.

#### 2.2.2 Key movements: abduction/adduction, side-bending, lateral shifting.

#### 2.2.3 Mechanical importance: balance, gait, joint protection.

### 2.3 Spinal/Longitudinal Axis (Extension/Compression)

#### 2.3.1 Anatomical structures: spine, core muscles, neck, lower back.

#### 2.3.2 Key movements: flexion/extension, lengthening, axial suspension.

#### 2.3.3 Mechanical importance: upright posture, shock absorption, neural protection.

## **3. Yin and Yang as Directions Along Each Axis**

### 3.1 Yin and Yang Principles: Physics Meets TCM

#### 3.1.1 Defining yin/yang as directional/functional pairs, not just energy.

#### 3.1.2 Mapping flexor/extensor, up/down, in/out to axes.

#### 3.1.3 How each axis expresses both yin (soft, flexion, internal) and yang (hard, extension, external) in mechanics and movement.

### 3.2 Clinical Relevance of Yin/Yang Mapping

#### 3.2.1 Joint health and injury: overloading yin vs. yang structures.

#### 3.2.2 Restoring balance for pain prevention and rehabilitation.

## **4. Meridian Theory in 3D Context**

### 4.1 Grouping Meridians by Mechanical Axis

#### 4.1.1 Rationale for axis-based grouping.

#### 4.1.2 Rotational Axis Meridians - Spleen, Stomach, Large Intestine, Lung

#### 4.1.3 Lateral Axis Meridians - Triple Warmer (San Jiao), Pericardium, Gallbladder, Liver

#### 4.1.4 Spinal/Longitudinal Axis Meridians - Bladder, Kidney, Small Intestine, Heart

### 4.2 Why Meridian Groupings Matter for Structure and Health

#### 4.2.1 The role of meridians as guides to mechanical and energetic flow.

#### 4.2.2 Matching movement patterns to meridian pathways for injury prevention and healing.

#### 4.2.3 How this paradigm translates TCM into biomechanical language.

### 4.3 Visualizing and Applying the Model

#### 4.3.1 Sample diagrams: mapping axes and meridian pairs on the body.

#### 4.3.2 Practical cues: recognizing axis dominance and deficiencies in movement.

#### 4.3.3 Movement and clinical tests to assess axis and meridian function.

## **5. Bringing It All Together: Blueprint for 3D Mechanical Health**

### 5.1 Integrated Assessment: Axes, Meridian, and Function

#### 5.1.1 Quick checks for axis balance in posture and motion.

#### 5.1.2 Identifying and correcting misalignments using both biomechanical and meridian logic.

### 5.2 Training and Therapy

#### 5.2.1 Exercise strategies to reinforce strong axis function.

#### 5.2.2 Use of breath, posture, and movement to balance 3D load.

### 5.3 Clinical Cases and Vignettes

#### 5.3.1 Example: rotational deficiency and chronic low back pain.

#### 5.3.2 Example: lateral instability and recurrent ankle sprains.

#### 5.3.3 Example: spinal axis collapse and loss of upright posture.

### 6.1 Summary of Key Insights

#### 6.1.1 Why 3D thinking changes prevention, diagnosis, and practice.

#### 6.1.2 The importance of integrating axes and meridians in future models.

### 6.2 Preparing for the Synthesis: Tradition, Tensegrity, and Breath

#### 6.2.1 Preview of the next section: tying together all axes, meridians, and movement into a unified paradigm.
