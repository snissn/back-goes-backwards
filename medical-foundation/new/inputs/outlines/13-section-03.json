    "Chapter 9 — Where Mechanics Already Lives in Medicine": {
      "description": "Lower resistance and establish legitimacy by showing mechanics already exists in routine medical reasoning.",
      "Job": {
        "description": "Establish common ground: medicine already uses mechanical reasoning and mechanical interventions, but without a unified load-routing framework This does not introduce a new treatment system; it extends existing mechanical reasoning into a unifying load-routing lens."
      },
      "Inputs / Outputs": {
        "description": "Inputs: Parts I–II mechanical/biological vocabulary. Outputs: reader concedes mechanics is not foreign to medicine and this is an internal extension, not an external critique."
      },
      "Core moves": {
        "description": "Show mechanical substitution is accepted (CPR, ventilation, fixation); show core health concepts rely on mechanics (pressure, conduit patency, pumps); show medicine treats mechanical endpoints (decompression, replacement) without overclaiming upstream causality."

      },
      "Core moves": {
        "description": "Define where the model applies; define where it does not; show epistemic tiering; separate mechanical phenomena from immune/infectious/genetic primaries; explicitly differentiate OA (mechanical) vs RA (immune) as an example of boundary setting."

      "Allowed examples": {
        "description": "Simple boundary exemplars (OA vs RA) used as a scope demonstration, not a comprehensive rheumatology discussion."

        "description": "Inputs: Chapters 9–11. Outputs: reader accepts this as “medical relevance” without it becoming a PT manual."
      },
      "Core moves": {
        "description": "Explain why PT is downstream; argue relevance to non-injured populations; tie mechanical stress routing to medical-scale concerns (e.g., energy cost, recovery context, functional reserve) while staying conservative Emphasize that the value is upstream: it changes how clinicians interpret risk, functional reserve, and symptom context in ambiguous or chronic presentations (e.g., fatigue, low resilience, diffuse pain) without claiming mechanics as the primary cause."
      },
      "Allowed examples": {
        "description": "High-level examples of medical contexts where mechanical reasoning alters interpretation (no prescriptions) Brief, conservative examples: posture/load context shifting symptom burden and recovery cost in non-specific presentations (no diagnoses, no prescriptions)."

        "description": "Safe exemplars of compensation/geometry driving load (e.g., scoliosis as geometry, disc degeneration patterns) without overreach."
      },
      "Micro-vignette (failure signature example)": {
        "description": "A 38-year-old office worker reports intermittent low back stiffness that gradually progressed to persistent right-sided pain over two years. There is no history of trauma, lumbar imaging is non-specific, and the neurological exam is normal. Observation shows forward head posture, anterior pelvic tilt, and minimal posterior chain engagement during standing. The pattern suggests load concentration at the right lumbosacral junction with compensatory tension across the thoracolumbar fascia and contralateral paraspinals. Symptoms fluctuate with posture and duration of standing, consistent with cumulative load misrouting and soft-tissue buffering reaching capacity over time."

      },
      "Core moves": {
        "description": "Present load-routing as context (not diagnosis, not diagnostic criteria); show interface with diagnostics/pharm/surgery; include skeptic section with disciplined replies; use TOS as a corridor-constraint exemplar strictly for symptom modulation and reasoning about space/load geometry (no causality claims, no “resolution” framing)."
      },
      "Allowed examples": {
        "description": "TOS as corridor constraint with conservative framing: posture/space can modulate symptoms; imaging can be non-diagnostic; this is not a claim of etiology and not a diagnostic template. Examples of how mechanical context changes what questions you ask."
