# Appendix: Diagnoses with Biomechanical Components

Clinician-facing reference taxonomy (expandable; anatomical region first)

Companion reference list of conditions where mechanical influence is well documented and defensible, organized by anatomical region. Each entry should be framed conservatively (pattern/signature language), avoiding deterministic disease-causality chains. This appendix is a supplemental reference taxonomy, not part of the book’s core causal argument. Entries should be treated as conservative exemplars/patterns and may be tiered by claim-strength.
## Cervical Spine

## Thoracic Spine

## Lumbar Spine
