Why your knees hurt when you treat them like simple hinges
	1.	The knee is a torque‑converter, not a door hinge.
	•	The tibio‑femoral joint finishes every step with ~10° of automatic external rotation – the “screw‑home” mechanism that tightens the cruciate ligaments and locks the knee for weight‑bearing  ￼ ￼.
	•	To unlock and flex again, the popliteus first internally rotates the tibia (open‑chain) or the femur (closed‑chain) – another rotation, not a straight slide. This built‑in twist tells us the knee’s natural job is to manage rotational coupling between what the hip is doing above and what the foot is doing below.
	2.	Rotation starts at the ends of the chain.
	•	Hip: When the glutes fire they create external rotation at the femoral head. If that torque cannot travel through the knee (e.g., the knee is forced to “face straight ahead”), it dissipates as shear inside the joint, irritating menisci, cartilage and ligaments.
	•	Ankle / rear‑foot: Supination is coupled to tibial external rotation; pronation couples with internal rotation. Several gait studies show the rear‑foot and hip move in coordinated spirals around the knee  ￼. Adequate tibial rotation at the ankle lets the knee “stack” safely under load  ￼.
	3.	What goes wrong with the “knees‑forward, drive‑linear” mindset

Situation	Hidden rotation you’re blocking	Typical symptoms
Squatting with knees pinned straight ahead while feet slightly turned out	Hip wants to keep externally rotating; tibia is forced inward → torsion at meniscus	Medial or patello‑femoral pain
Running/cutting with hip collapsing into internal rotation (dynamic knee valgus)	Foot fixed, femur internally rotates, tibia forced to follow	ACL strain, IT‑band irritation, PF pain  ￼ ￼
Walking downhill with ankles over‑pronated	Tibia spins in, femur can’t counter‑rotate	Front‑of‑knee ache, pes anserine tenderness


	4.	How to use the knee’s rotational design instead of fighting it

Cue	What it achieves
“Screw your feet into the ground” (press big toe & outer heel, imagine twisting the floor outward)	Allows the tibia to externally rotate relative to the femur, finishing the screw‑home lock without compressing the joint.
“Show your kneecaps the same direction as the 2nd–3rd toe”	Keeps femur and tibia rotating together, avoiding shear.
“Lead rotation from the hip, let the knee follow”	Glute‑driven external rotation shares load across hip capsule, IT‑band and lateral hamstring instead of isolating cartilage.
Mobilise the ankle (lateral glide & calf stretch)	Restores tibial rotational freedom so the knee doesn’t take the hit when the foot pronates or supinates.


	5.	Putting it into practice
Standing rise / squat drill
	1.	Barefoot, feet hip‑width, toes pointing exactly where kneecaps point.
	2.	Spread the floor: feel weight under big toe, little toe, heel.
	3.	Gently cork‑screw the thighs outward (you’ll feel the arches lift slightly).
	4.	Keep that spiral as you hinge hips back and sit. Knees will track over mid‑foot without collapsing.
	5.	Stand by driving through the tripod foot while maintaining the external spiral – your knees should feel like passengers, not drivers.
Walking check
	•	On each stride notice a subtle outward roll of the thigh just before heel strike and a gentle inward roll as you push off. That reciprocating twist is normal; pain often appears when one half of the cycle is missing.

Key takeaway:
Treat the knee as the middle gear in a rotational system: hip → knee → ankle. Let external rotation generated at the hip (and balanced by the ankle) pass through the knee. Forcing the joint to stay “forward” and pushing linearly overloads soft tissue and is a common recipe for chronic knee pain. Shift your mindset from “keep knees still” to “coordinate the spiral,” and the joint can lock, unlock and load the way anatomy intended.
