## **Ground-State Reset – 5-Minute Bilateral Routine**

A single **left-and-right run-through** of the three loops below will unwind any postural pattern and land you in the mechanically optimal “ground state.”
No decisions or tests mid-flow—just do each side exactly as written.

---

## **Rib Loop – Rebalance Rib Cage & Scapula** *(all standing, \~3 min)*

---

### **Step R1 Reciprocate the Ribs** *(breaks rib synergy)*

1. **Right:**

   * Reach the **right arm** overhead, palm in.
   * **Inhale** 4 s—feel the right flank expand sideways.
   * **Exhale** 6 s—let the **left scapula** glide down and back.
2. **Left:** Repeat with sides reversed.

---

### **Step R2 Discharge Posterior Twist** *(unloads stiff back tissues)*

1. **Right:** Keep right arm up.

   * **Exhale**—side-bend toward the raised arm (body arcs right).
   * Gentle **chin tuck**—eyes drop slightly with the nod.
   * **Inhale**—return to center.
2. **Left:** Mirror the action.

---

### **Step R3 Equalise Rib Volume** *(removes one-sided compression)*

1. **Right:** Both hands on right lower ribs.

   * Take **3 quiet breaths**, widening ribs into palms.
2. **Left:** Move hands to left ribs; repeat.

---

### **Step R4 Align with Gravity** *(re-centres spine under skull)*

* Stand tall, arms relaxed.
* For **3 slow breaths**:

  * **Exhale**—let the tailbone melt downward.
  * **Inhale**—feel the crown float upward, lengthening the spine.

---

### **Step R5 Set Axial Balance** *(locks in correct front/back torque)*

* Lace fingers lightly behind the skull.
* For **2 breaths**:

  * **Inhale**—sternum glides back and up (subtle).
  * **Exhale**—maintain length, no shoulder shrug.

---

### **Step R6 Sweep Residual Twist** *(clears tiny front-chain spirals)*

1. **Right sweep:**

   * Right hand on sternum, fingers left.
   * **Exhale**—gently draw breastbone a finger-width right; gaze follows.
   * **Inhale**—release, return to center.
2. **Left sweep:**

   * Left hand on sternum, fingers right.
   * **Exhale**—draw breastbone left; eyes follow.
   * **Inhale**—release, return to neutral.

---

## **Hip Loop – Rebalance Pelvis & SI Joints** *(all standing, \~1 min)*

---

### **Step H1 Reciprocate the Hemipelves** *(sets pelvic coupling, undoes “duck-foot” torque)*

1. **Right:**

   * Shift weight onto **right foot**; slide **left foot** back 10 cm.
   * **Inhale**—feel right hip widen.
   * **Exhale**—tuck left sit-bone under (fold pelvis forward on left).
2. **Left:**

   * Shift weight onto **left foot**; slide **right foot** back.
   * **Inhale**—feel left hip widen.
   * **Exhale**—tuck right sit-bone under.

*Tip: Keep a slight bend in the knees so the pelvis moves, not the low back.*

---

### **Step H2 Unload the Lumbar Twist** *(clears stored lumbar twist)*

1. **Right:**

   * Weight on **right foot** (left foot still back).
   * **Exhale**—spiral navel toward right leg as left arm counter-reaches.
   * **Inhale**—return to center.
2. **Left:**

   * Switch stance; weight on **left foot**, right foot back.
   * **Exhale**—spiral navel toward left leg as right arm counter-reaches.
   * **Inhale**—return.

---

### **Step H3 Equalise Iliac Volume** *(removes one-sided iliac compression)*

1. **Right:**

   * Both hands on front of **right hip**.
   * **Inhale**—expand waist into palms.
   * **Exhale**—soften right hip flexors.
   * Repeat for **two breaths**.
2. **Left:**

   * Hands on **left hip**.
   * **Inhale**—expand waist.
   * **Exhale**—soften left hip flexors.
   * Repeat for **two breaths**.

---

## **Skull Loop – Fine-Tune Cranio-Cervical Balance** *(all standing, \~40 s)*

---

### **Step K1 Occipital Float** *(balances occiput-atlas torque)*

1. **Right:**

   * Stand tall, eyes forward.
   * **Inhale**—lift right back corner of skull.
   * **Exhale**—let jaw swing slightly left.
2. **Left:**

   * **Inhale**—lift left back corner of skull.
   * **Exhale**—jaw swings slightly right.

---

### **Step K2 Jaw-Hyoid Spiral** *(clears residual anterior twist at skull base)*

1. **Right:**

   * Tongue to roof of mouth.
   * **Exhale**—spiral jaw subtly toward right back corner.
   * **Inhale**—return jaw to center.
2. **Left:**

   * Tongue up.
   * **Exhale**—spiral jaw subtly left.
   * **Inhale**—center.

### **You’re Done – Quick Confirmation**

Take one natural inhale.

> **Both sides of your ribcage should now expand evenly.**
> If not, run the routine again.

### **Routine at a Glance**

| Segment        | Step Count | Key Cue                   | Targeted Region  |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Rib Loop**   | 6 steps    | Reach, bend, inflate      | Thorax & scapula |
| **Hip Loop**   | 3 steps    | Shift, spiral, expand     | Pelvis & lumbar  |
| **Skull Loop** | 2 steps    | Occiput float, jaw spiral | Cranio-cervical  |

**Use one full cycle daily** for maintenance.
**Up to three cycles** back-to-back for stubborn patterns.
No measurements or decisions needed—just follow the script and let your body reset.
