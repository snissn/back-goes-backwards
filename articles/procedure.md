## **Ground-State Reset – 3-Minute Bilateral Routine**

A single **left-and-right run-through** of the six moves below will unwind any postural pattern and land you in the mechanically optimal “ground state.”
No decisions, no tests mid-flow—just do each side exactly as written.

---

### **Step 1 Reciprocate the Ribs** *(breaks rib synergy)*

1. **Right:**

   * Reach the **right arm** overhead, palm in.
   * **Inhale** 4 s—feel the right flank expand sideways.
   * **Exhale** 6 s—let the **left scapula** glide down and back.
2. **Left:** repeat with sides reversed.

---

### **Step 2 Discharge Posterior Twist** *(unloads stiff back tissues)*

1. **Right:** keep right arm up.

   * **Exhale** as you **side-bend toward the raised arm** (body arcs right).
   * Add a gentle **chin tuck**, letting the **eyes drop slightly** with the nod.
   * **Inhale** return to centre.
2. **Left:** mirror the action.

---

### **Step 3 Equalise Rib Volume** *(removes one-sided compression)*

1. **Right:** place **both hands on right lower ribs**.

   * Take **3 quiet breaths**, widening the ribs sideways into your palms.
2. **Left:** move hands to left ribs; repeat 3 breaths.

---

### **Step 4 Align with Gravity** *(re-centres spine under skull)*

* Stand (or sit) tall, arms relaxed.
* For **3 slow breaths**:

  * **Exhale**—let the **tailbone melt downward** into the floor.
  * **Inhale**—feel the **crown float upward**, as if lengthening the spine.

---

### **Step 5 Set Axial Balance** *(locks in correct front/back torque)*

* Lace fingers **lightly behind the skull**.
* On each of **2 breaths**:

  1. **Inhale**—allow the **sternum to glide back and up** (subtle).
  2. **Exhale**—keep that length without shrugging shoulders.

---

### **Step 6 Sweep Residual Twist** *(clears tiny front-chain spirals)*

1. **Right sweep:**

   * Right hand rests on sternum, fingers pointing left.
   * **Exhale**—use your hand to gently draw your breastbone a finger-width to the **right**; let your gaze follow the movement.
   * **Inhale**—release the pull and allow your chest to return to center.

2. **Left sweep:**

   * Left hand rests on sternum, fingers pointing right.
   * **Exhale**—gently draw your breastbone to the **left**; eyes follow.
   * **Inhale**—release and let the chest come back to neutral.

### **You’re Done – Quick Confirmation**

Take one natural inhale.

> **Both sides of your ribcage should now expand evenly.**
> If they don’t, run the entire six-step sequence once more.

### **Routine at a Glance**

| Step | Breath Count     | Key Cue               | Fixes              |
| ---- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1    | 1 breath / side  | Reach-&-melt          | Rib torque balance |
| 2    | 1 breath / side  | Bend + chin tuck      | Posterior twist    |
| 3    | 3 breaths / side | Hands-on-ribs inflate | Rib compression    |
| 4    | 3 central        | Tail down, crown up   | Gravity line       |
| 5    | 2 central        | Sternum glides back   | Axial torque set   |
| 6    | 1 breath / side  | Micro spirals         | Residual twist     |

Use **one full cycle daily** for maintenance; up to **three cycles** back-to-back for stubborn patterns. No measurements or side-decisions needed—just follow the script and let your body reset.
