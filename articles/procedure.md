## **Ground-State Reset – 5-Minute Bilateral Routine**

A single **left-and-right run-through** of the three sections below will unwind any postural pattern and land you in the mechanically optimal “ground state.”

 * No decisions or tests mid-flow—just do each side exactly as written.

---

### **Rib Loop – Rebalance Rib Cage & Scapula** *(all standing, \~3 min)*

---

### **Step R1 Reciprocate the Ribs** *(breaks rib synergy)*

1. **Right:**
   * Reach the **right arm** overhead, palm in.
   * **Inhale** 4 s—feel the right flank expand sideways.
   * **Exhale** 6 s—let the **left scapula** glide down and back.

2. **Left:** repeat with sides reversed.

---

### **Step R2 Discharge Posterior Twist** *(unloads stiff back tissues)*

1. **Right:** keep right arm up.

   * **Exhale** as you **side-bend toward the raised arm** (body arcs right).
   * Add a gentle **chin tuck**, letting the **eyes drop slightly** with the nod.
   * **Inhale** return to centre.
2. **Left:** mirror the action.

---

### **Step R3 Equalise Rib Volume** *(removes one-sided compression)*

1. **Right:** place **both hands on right lower ribs**.

   * Take **3 quiet breaths**, widening the ribs sideways into your palms.
2. **Left:** move hands to left ribs; repeat 3 breaths.

---

### **Step R4 Align with Gravity** *(re-centres spine under skull)*

* Stand (or sit) tall, arms relaxed.
* For **3 slow breaths**:

  * **Exhale**—let the **tailbone melt downward** into the floor.
  * **Inhale**—feel the **crown float upward**, as if lengthening the spine.

---

### **Step R5 Set Axial Balance** *(locks in correct front/back torque)*

* Lace fingers **lightly behind the skull**.
* On each of **2 breaths**:

  1. **Inhale**—allow the **sternum to glide back and up** (subtle).
  2. **Exhale**—keep that length without shrugging shoulders.

---

### **Step R6 Sweep Residual Twist** *(clears tiny front-chain spirals)*

1. **Right sweep:**

   * Right hand rests on sternum, fingers pointing left.
   * **Exhale**—use your hand to gently draw your breastbone a finger-width to the **right**; let your gaze follow the movement.
   * **Inhale**—release the pull and allow your chest to return to center.

2. **Left sweep:**

   * Left hand rests on sternum, fingers pointing right.
   * **Exhale**—gently draw your breastbone to the **left**; eyes follow.
   * **Inhale**—release and let the chest come back to neutral.

---

### **Hip Loop – Rebalance Pelvis & SI Joints** *(all standing, 1 min)*

---

### **Step H1 Reciprocate the Hemipelves** *(sets pelvic coupling, undoes “duck-foot” torque)*

1. **Right:**
   * Shift your weight fully onto your **right foot**.
   * Slide the **left foot** back about 10 cm (4 inches), toes touching down lightly.
   * **Inhale**—feel the **right greater trochanter** (hip bone) widen out to the side.
   * **Exhale**—gently **tuck the left sit-bone** (ischial tuberosity) under, as if folding the left side of the pelvis forward.

2. **Left:**
   * Shift your weight fully onto your **left foot**.
   * Slide the **right foot** back about 10 cm (4 inches), toes touching down lightly.
   * **Inhale**—feel the **left greater trochanter** (hip bone) widen out to the side.
   * **Exhale**—gently **tuck the right sit-bone** (ischial tuberosity) under, as if folding the right side of the pelvis forward.

*Tip: Keep a micro-bend in the knees to encourage movement at the pelvis, not the low back.*

### **Step H2 Unload the Lumbar Twist** *(clears stored lumbar/posterior twist)*

1. **Right:**
   * In the same stance, focus weight on the **right foot**.
   * **Exhale**—spiral your navel gently **toward the right leg** while your left arm counter-reaches (reaches forward or out to the left).
   * **Inhale**—return to neutral.

2. **Left:** 
   * In the same stance, focus weight on the **left foot**.
   * **Exhale**—spiral your navel gently **toward the left leg** while your right arm counter-reaches (reaches forward or out to the right).
   * **Inhale**—return to neutral.

---

### **Step H3 Equalise Iliac Volume** *(removes one-sided iliac compression)*

1. **Right:**
   * Place **both hands on the front** of your right hip.
   * **Inhale** into that waist, gently widening the space under your palms.
   * **Exhale**—let your right hip flexors soften and lengthen.
   * Repeat **two breaths**.

2. **Left:** 
   * Place **both hands on the front** of your left hip.
   * **Inhale** into that waist, gently widening the space under your palms.
   * **Exhale**—let your left hip flexors soften and lengthen.
   * Repeat **two breaths**.

---

## **Skull Loop – Fine-Tune Cranio-Cervical Balance** *(all standing, \~40 s)*

---

### **Step K1 Occipital Float** *(balances occiput-atlas torque)*

1. **Right:**
   * Stand tall, **eyes forward**.
   * **Inhale**—imagine subtly lifting the **right back corner of your skull** upward (like you’re “lengthening” that side of your head).
   * **Exhale**—let your **jaw swing slightly to the left** (opposite side).

2. **Left:** 
   * Stand tall, **eyes forward**.
   * **Inhale**—imagine subtly lifting the **left back corner of your skull** upward (like you’re “lengthening” that side of your head).
   * **Exhale**—let your **jaw swing slightly to the right** (opposite side).
---

### **Step K2 Jaw-Hyoid Spiral** *(clears residual anterior twist at skull base)*

1. **Right:**

   * With **tongue lightly touching the roof of your mouth**, focus on the right back corner of your skull.
   * **Exhale**—allow your **jaw to spiral microscopically toward the lifted corner** (right).
   * **Inhale**—return to neutral, center the jaw.
2. **Left:** 

   * With **tongue lightly touching the roof of your mouth**, focus on the left back corner of your skull.
   * **Exhale**—allow your **jaw to spiral microscopically toward the lifted corner** (left).
   * **Inhale**—return to neutral, center the jaw.

### **You’re Done – Quick Confirmation**

Take one natural inhale.

> **Both sides of your ribcage, pelvis, and neck should now feel balanced and move evenly.**
> If any area still feels restricted or uneven, repeat the entire routine once more from the top.

---

Use **one full cycle daily** for maintenance; up to **three cycles** back-to-back for stubborn patterns. No measurements or side-decisions needed—just follow the script and let your body reset.
