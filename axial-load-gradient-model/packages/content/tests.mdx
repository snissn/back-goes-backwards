# Tests

![Decision flow](/figures/fig-decision-flow.svg)

The Quick screen is designed to fit within 2 minutes and to flag which segment(s) are most likely accumulating load.

## Quick screen (SGS-120)

<ul>
  {tests.quick.steps.map((step) => (
    <li key={step.id}>
      <strong>{step.id}</strong> - {step.name} ({step.durationSec}s)
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>

Scoring:

- B-dominant: at most {tests.quick.scoring.bDominantMaxFails} fails
- Mixed: at most {tests.quick.scoring.mixedMaxFails} fails
- A-dominant: at least {tests.quick.scoring.aDominantMinFails} fails

## Adaptive branches

Use adaptive branches when the Quick screen flags a segment. The goal is to localize which joint or load path is failing before prescribing drills.

## Advanced validation

Advanced tests check whether a negative gradient can be maintained under load and time.
