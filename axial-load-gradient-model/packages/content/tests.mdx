# Tests

The model only matters if it is operational.
The tests are designed to answer two questions quickly:

1. Which segment(s) are most likely accumulating load right now?
2. Can a short intervention flip the sign?

<Callout kind="danger" title="Do not test">
  Do not run tests if there is progressive weakness/numbness, bowel or bladder changes, fever, severe unremitting pain, recent significant trauma, or other medical red flags.
</Callout>

## Quick screen (SGS-120)

Run the screen exactly the same way each time. Use it as a **before/after** probe.

## Interpretation

<Callout kind="heuristic" title="What a 'fail' means">
  A fail is not a moral judgment and not proof of a single anatomical cause. It is a routing signal: under that demand, a segment is likely acting as a load sink.
</Callout>

Typical immediate signatures:

- If arm elevation fails: thoracic/cervical routing is suspect (arms load goes up instead of down).
- If backward step fails: lumbar/hip acceptance is suspect (load doesn't settle posteriorly).
- If breath probe fails: cervical load-bearing is likely present (neck/shoulders lift to inhale).

## What to do with the result

- If you are B-dominant: you can train normally, but keep the negative-gradient builders as maintenance.
- If you are Mixed or A-dominant: use the wizard to select a minimal Tier 0/1 drill set and retest.

## Retest rule

<Callout kind="definition" title="Retest-driven stopping">
  The goal is not to accumulate exercises. Apply one drill, retest, and stop as soon as the screen flips.
</Callout>

If a segment does not flip, move to the adaptive branches (coming next) or increase tier carefully.
