# Model

![Axial load gradient states](/figures/fig-load-gradient-a-vs-b.svg)

## Definitions (mechanics-first)

- Axial coordinate: ground to head, normalized as `z in [0,1]`.
- Load function: `L(z)` is the net mechanical load transmitted at height `z`.
- Axial load gradient: `G(z) = dL/dz`.
  - `G(z) < 0`: load dissipates upward (downward-shedding, tension-routed)
  - `G(z) > 0`: load accumulates upward (compression-routed)

## Piecewise gradients

![Piecewise gradient segments](/figures/fig-piecewise-segments.svg)

Define segment averages:

- `g_L`: lumbar segment
- `g_T`: thoracic segment
- `g_C`: cervical segment

State vector:

`S = (sign(g_L), sign(g_T), sign(g_C))`

There are 8 canonical sign patterns. The model treats these as routing regimes, not postural morals.

## Inversion loci

An inversion locus is a region where the sign of `G` flips. Symptoms tend to localize where a segment accumulates load or where the routing strategy changes abruptly.
