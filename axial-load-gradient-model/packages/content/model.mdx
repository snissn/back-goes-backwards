# Model

The Axial Load Gradient Model (ALGM) is a mechanics-first way to talk about **load routing**.
Instead of labeling muscles as weak/tight, it asks a simpler question:

> When load changes, does it **shed downward** through tension networks, or **accumulate upward** into compression-dominant structures?

<Callout kind="danger" title="Medical scope">
  This is an engineering-style movement model, not medical advice. It does not diagnose or treat disease. Do not run tests if you have red flags (progressive neurologic deficit, bowel/bladder changes, fever, severe unremitting pain, recent significant trauma).
</Callout>

## Core objects

<Callout kind="definition" title="Axial coordinate">
  Define an axial coordinate <code>z</code> along the body: ground (low) to head (high), normalized to <code>z in [0,1]</code>.
</Callout>

<Callout kind="definition" title="Load function">
  Let <code>L(z)</code> be the net mechanical load transmitted at height <code>z</code> through the axial system. This is not EMG and not “effort”; it is force transmission (tension + compression + shear as an effective quantity).
</Callout>

<Callout kind="definition" title="Axial load gradient">
  Define <code>G(z) = dL/dz</code>. Interpreting the sign:
  <ul>
    <li><code>G(z) &lt; 0</code>: load <strong>dissipates upward</strong> (downward-shedding bias)</li>
    <li><code>G(z) &gt; 0</code>: load <strong>accumulates upward</strong> (upward-accumulating bias)</li>
  </ul>
</Callout>

## Two regimes (operational)

These are not moral categories. They are **control regimes** you can detect with simple tests.

<Callout kind="heuristic" title="State B: negative-gradient default">
  A mechanically organized baseline tends to show predominantly negative gradients: load is highest low and is progressively shed as height increases.
</Callout>

<Callout kind="heuristic" title="State A: positive-gradient default">
  A mechanically disorganized baseline tends to show predominantly positive gradients: load accumulates upward and the upper spine/neck become load sinks.
</Callout>

## Piecewise gradients by segment

The global gradient can be approximated as three segment averages:

- <code>g_L</code>: lumbar
- <code>g_T</code>: thoracic
- <code>g_C</code>: cervical

Define the sign-vector:

<code>S = (sign(g_L), sign(g_T), sign(g_C))</code>

<Callout kind="hypothesis" title="Why this matters">
  Symptoms and fatigue often localize where a segment accumulates load (<code>g &gt; 0</code>) or where routing strategies change abruptly (an inversion locus).
</Callout>

## Inversion loci

An inversion locus is a region where the sign of the gradient flips.
In practice, these often cluster near junctions (lumbar/thoracic/cervical transitions), but the model treats the locus as a measurable feature, not a diagnosis.

## What makes this model useful

- It is **testable**: you can run a consistent screen and watch it change.
- It is **actionable**: drills are classified by expected sign effects and validated by retest.
- It is **composable**: you can treat complex patterns as a 3-segment sign state.
