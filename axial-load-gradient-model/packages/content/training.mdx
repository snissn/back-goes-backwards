# Training

The training system is gradient-first.
Instead of asking “what muscle does this hit?”, it asks:

- Does this drill tend to push the system toward **negative gradients** (downward shedding)?
- Or is it a **positive-gradient excursion** (useful later, but not for flipping a collapse pattern)?

<Callout kind="definition" title="Dosing standard">
  To make drills comparable, keep doses stable (e.g. 4-6 breaths, 15-30s hangs, 45-90s backward walk). Then retest.
</Callout>

## Tier 0-1: negative-gradient builders (main library)

These are the safest defaults for flipping common inversions.

<DrillGrid tierMin={0} tierMax={1} />

## Tier 2: global integrators (use with care)

These can be powerful, but they are easier to contaminate with neck/rib bracing.

<DrillGrid tierMin={2} tierMax={2} />

## Positive-gradient excursions (context)

Some tasks inherently require upward accumulation (sprint starts, jumps, heavy overhead press). They are not “bad.”
They are trained only when you can reliably return to negative gradients within a short window afterward.

## Minimal protocol selection

The program (CLI/wizard) does this:

1. Infer target segments from the Quick screen failures.
2. Choose the smallest drill set that pushes those segments negative without worsening others.
3. Order drills (cervical -> thoracic -> lumbar -> global).
4. Execute one drill, retest, stop when flipped.

<Callout kind="heuristic" title="Why minimal matters">
  If you need 8 drills to feel better, you probably don't know which drill changed the sign.
  Minimal protocols make the system testable and debuggable.
</Callout>
