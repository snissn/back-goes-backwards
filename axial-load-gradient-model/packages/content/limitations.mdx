# Limitations

This notebook is intentionally conservative about claims.

<Callout kind="definition" title="What the model is">
  A testable hypothesis framework for movement organization: define a load routing quantity, classify by gradient sign, and validate changes by retest.
</Callout>

<Callout kind="definition" title="What the model is not">
  A diagnosis, a pathology detector, or a single-cause explanation for pain.
</Callout>

## Practical constraints

- The sign of <code>G(z)</code> is inferred from proxies. Instrumentation would be needed for direct measurement.
- Many confounders can change test performance (fatigue, acute injury, vestibular issues, fear/guarding).
- Some tasks are expected to be positive-gradient excursions.

## Safety constraints

If you have numbness/tingling, progressive weakness, bowel/bladder changes, fever, severe unremitting pain, or recent significant trauma, do not test.
