# Limitations

- This model does not diagnose or treat disease.
- Symptom clusters are not causes; they are routing hypotheses that require validation.
- The model assumes no acute injury, severe osteoarthritis, or neurologic instability.
- A positive gradient in one segment can be a task-specific excursion, not pathology.
- Mechanistic claims require direct measurement to be confirmed (force plate, imaging, EMG, etc.).
