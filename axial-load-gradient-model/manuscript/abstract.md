# Abstract

The Axial Load Gradient Model (ALGM) describes how mechanical load routes through the body and how healthy movement tends to shed load downward rather than accumulate it upward. The model defines an axial load function `L(z)`, its gradient `G(z)`, and piecewise gradients by spinal segment. It provides operational tests and a drill taxonomy based on gradient sign.

This is an engineering-style movement model, not medical advice.
