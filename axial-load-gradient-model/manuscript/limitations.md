# Limitations

- The model is not diagnostic and does not replace clinical evaluation.
- Symptom clusters are not causal proofs; they are routing hypotheses.
- Acute injury, severe OA, or neurologic instability are contraindications for testing.
- Empirical validation requires instrumentation and longitudinal study.
