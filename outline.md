---

### **Section 1: Core Concepts and Foundations of Spinal Health**

#### **Chapter 1: The Back Moves Backwards – Introduction to the Theory**
   - Introduces the main concept that the spine should be loaded backwards and explores the impact of modern forward-loading habits on health. Sets the foundation for biomechanical, energetic, and yogic perspectives.

#### **Chapter 2: Understanding the Six Stages and the Meridians**
   - Explains the Six Stages (Tai Yang, Yang Ming, etc.) and the 12 meridians of the body, focusing on how they influence posture, movement, and spinal health in Ashtanga yoga.

#### **Chapter 3: The Governing and Conception Vessels – The Spine’s Key Energy Pathways**

### **Section 2: Spinal Biomechanics and Energy Flow**

#### **Chapter 4: Biomechanics of the Spine – Forces, Curvature, and Alignment**
   - A technical exploration of spinal mechanics, focusing on how forces are distributed, the importance of maintaining spinal curvature, and the physical impacts of alignment on overall health.

#### **Chapter 5: The Role of Backbends in Strengthening the Spine**
   - Discusses how backbends in yoga help reinforce the spine’s natural curves and strengthen the posterior chain, allowing for a balanced, supported structure.

#### **Chapter 6: Forward Bends and the Conception Vessel**
   - Explores the effect of forward bends, their relationship with the conception vessel, and how they should be approached to avoid mechanical stress and maintain energy balance.

#### **Chapter 7: Twists and Lateral Movements**
   - Examines spinal twists and lateral movements, discussing their importance in spinal mobility, balancing meridians, and releasing energy blockages.

### **Section 3: Integration of Ashtanga Yoga and Tai Chi**

#### **Chapter 8: Integrating Tai Chi Movements for Spinal Flow**
   - Introduces Tai Chi as a complementary practice to Ashtanga, focusing on how its movements support spinal alignment and energy flow through the meridians.

#### **Chapter 9: Primary Series of Ashtanga – Building Strength Along the Back**
   - Focuses on the Primary Series, its connection to the Yang meridians, and how it systematically strengthens and aligns the spine through progressive postures.

#### **Chapter 10: Second Series of Ashtanga – Unlocking Deeper Spinal Movement**
   - Examines the Second Series, which deepens backbends and spinal articulations, engaging the meridians to unlock energy and flexibility.

#### **Chapter 11: Advanced Series – Mastery of the Spine’s Potential**
   - Delves into the advanced series, exploring how these more complex poses provide mastery over spinal movement and energy control, enhancing physical and energetic resilience.

### **Section 4: Health Implications of Spinal Alignment**

#### **Chapter 12: Spinal Misalignment and Disease**
   - Discusses the health problems that arise from spinal misalignment, such as joint issues, autoimmune diseases, and impaired lymphatic flow.

#### **Chapter 13: Lymphatic Health and Spinal Alignment**
   - Examines the role of the lymphatic system, and how improper spinal alignment impacts fluid drainage and immune function.

#### **Chapter 14: Immune Health and Chronic Conditions**
   - Explores the link between spinal mechanics, immune function, and chronic conditions such as arthritis and Crohn’s disease.

### **Section 5: Restoring Balance and Health Through Movement**

#### **Chapter 15: Restoring Alignment Through Tai Chi and Yoga**
   - Explains how combining the practices of Tai Chi and Ashtanga yoga can restore spinal alignment and balance energy for improved health.

#### **Chapter 16: The Role of Restorative Asanas and Yin Practices**
   - Discusses how slower, yin-oriented yoga practices can aid recovery and balance the body’s energy by engaging the deeper meridians and tissues.

#### **Chapter 17: The Role of Meditation in Supporting the Spine and Energy Flow**
   - Focuses on meditation’s role in maintaining spinal health and how it supports both the physical and energetic alignment of the body.
