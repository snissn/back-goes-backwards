- **Creating Balance through the Bladder Meridians**:
  - Detail how the Bladder Meridians along the spine support stability in rotation, helping to manage tension shifts as the body spirals and extends.
- **Counterbalancing with Lateral Shift**:
  - Emphasize the need for a subtle lateral shift opposite to the twist direction, maintaining a harmonious balance in the Bladder Meridians to support rotational extension.
