Chapter 9: Integration of the Six Stages into Ashtanga Yoga Practice

# Chapter 9: Integration of the Six Stages into Ashtanga Yoga Practice

As we bring together the teachings of the Six Stages of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and the practice of Ashtanga Yoga, we can begin to see how these ancient systems of healing and movement are not only complementary but deeply intertwined when it comes to spinal health and overall well-being. The spine, the central axis of the body, is more than just a physical structure. It is also the core through which energy, or Qi (Chi), flows. When we understand how yoga postures (asanas) engage the body’s meridian system—channels through which Qi flows—we unlock new possibilities in both physical movement and internal healing. 

In this chapter, we will take a detailed look at how the body’s meridian channels are activated within the framework of Ashtanga Yoga, and how the progression of postures, from simpler to more complex, mirrors the energetic journey through the Six Stages. Understanding these stages will empower practitioners to use their Ashtanga practice not just to stretch and strengthen the body but also to optimize their energy flow, balance yin and yang energies, and target both physical and emotional well-being.

## **The Six Stages in Ashtanga Yoga: The Foundation of Energy and Movement**

The Six Stages, as detailed in TCM, represent various layers of the body’s energy field, starting from the most external to the most internal. These stages correlate with specific meridians, and understanding how they interact with yoga postures offers a powerful way to deepen our practice:

1. **Tai Yang (Greater Yang)** – Represents the most external layer, governing the Bladder and Small Intestine meridians.
2. **Yang Ming (Bright Yang)** – Controls the Stomach and large intestine, focusing on digestion, nourishment, and energy storage.
3. **Shao Yang (Lesser Yang)** – A pivot between exterior and interior, governing the Gallbladder and Triple Burner meridians.
4. **Tai Yin (Greater Yin)** – Focuses on the internal organs, specifically the Lungs and Spleen, affecting breath and digestion.
5. **Shao Yin (Lesser Yin)** – Governs the Heart and Kidneys, diving into emotional and elemental balance.
6. **Jue Yin (Reverting Yin)** – The deepest level, involving the Liver and Pericardium, responsible for detoxification and emotional transformation.

### **Yang to Yin: Structuring and Releasing Energy through Asanas**

The practice of Ashtanga Yoga progresses logically through a sequence of postures that engage both the physical body and the meridians, producing a dynamic balance of yang and yin energy. While “yang” is characterized by structure, effort, and heat, “yin” allows for relaxation, release, and stillness. The interplay between these two can be likened to building a solid house (yang) and creating an inviting, comfortable interior (yin). In Ashtanga, each asana starts with a strong yang foundation, followed by deeper engagement of the yin meridians, which leads to relaxation and energetic release.

To better understand this dynamic, let’s explore how yang and yin meridians are activated through specific postures:

---

### **Primary Series (Yoga Chikitsa) – Detoxification Through Yang Structure**

The **Primary Series** in Ashtanga Yoga is called "Yoga Chikitsa," which translates to "Yoga Therapy." As the name suggests, this series is focused on cleansing and healing the body, and much of this is achieved through engaging the yang meridians. At this stage, we often create heat in the body, stimulating the digestive system, promoting detoxification, and laying a strong foundation for spinal health.

#### **Example Posture: Padangusthasana (Big Toe Pose)**

- **Physical Action**: In Padangusthasana, you stand with feet hip-width apart, fold forward, and grasp your big toes with your fingers. As you pull gently on your toes, your hamstrings lengthen, and your spine extends, elongating the entire back body.
- **Meridian Activation**: This posture engages the **Bladder meridian**. The Bladder meridian is the longest meridian, running along the whole back of the body—from the head, down the spine, and through the legs to the feet. By folding forward, you target this yang meridian, stretching and releasing tension along the spine.
- **Yang Structure**: As you elongate the spine and ground through your feet, you establish a strong connection with the earth, reinforcing the structural alignment of the back body.
- **Energetic Impact**: This creates a powerful release of stagnant energy, encouraging detoxification and providing tension relief. The focused control of **Ujjayi breath** (victorious breath) further ignites this process, stimulating Qi flow through the Bladder meridian.

#### **Key Benefits:**
- Promote spinal flexibility and release tension in the back body.
- Stimulate lower body organs connected to elimination, aiding in detox.

### **Intermediate Series (Nadi Shodhana) – Restoring Energetic Balance**

The **Intermediate Series**, also known as **Nadi Shodhana**, or "Nerve Cleansing," builds upon the detoxification work done in the Primary Series and focuses on balancing the body’s energetic pathways. Here, practitioners begin to work deeper, engaging both yang and yin meridians equally and exploring more emotionally-connected poses that twist and open vulnerable areas of the body like the chest and hips.

#### **Example Posture: Pasasana (Noose Pose)**

- **Physical Action**: In Pasasana, you take a deep squat while twisting your torso, hooking your arms around your knees and clasping your hands behind your back.
- **Meridian Activation**: This twisting motion activates both the **Kidney** meridian (which runs along the inner legs and up into the spine) and the **Stomach** meridian (along the front body). Twisting helps wring out the body’s “energetic sponge,” encouraging deeper organ detoxification and the release of stored emotions.
- **Yin Flexibility and Release**: This asana takes the foundation established in the Primary Series (yang) and softens into a yin state, where deeper layers of emotional energy are accessed. By engaging the Kidney meridian, you are also working on the essence of vitality, which stores our deepest reserves of energy.
- **Energetic Impact**: Twists balance the body’s left and right sides, energetically aligning Qi along the governing and conception vessels—two key meridians coursing up and down the spine (we'll explore these more shortly). Twisting postures like Pasasana help relieve tension from the spine, promoting detoxification on both physical and energetic levels.

#### **Key Benefits:**
- Stimulate deep detoxification of organs such as the kidneys and stomach.
- Restore balance by releasing physical and emotional tension.

### **Advanced Series (Sthira Bhaga) – Mastering the Flow of Qi**

The **Advanced Series**, sometimes called **Sthira Bhaga** ("Divine Stability"), represents the pinnacle of Ashtanga Yoga practice. These postures are challenging physically, mentally, and energetically, requiring deep engagement with both yang and yin forces to maintain balance. By this stage, practitioners are mastering the energy of the body, moving deeper into the yin meridians such as the Liver and Pericardium meridians to unlock spiritual clarity and harmony.

#### **Example Posture: Urdhva Dhanurasana (Upward Bow Pose)**

- **Physical Action**: In Urdhva Dhanurasana, you lift into a full backbend, hands pressing into the floor as your chest opens fully.
- **Meridian Activation**: This posture is strongly linked to the **Heart** and **Pericardium** meridians, which run through the chest and shoulders. These two meridians govern our emotional world, especially our ability to open our hearts and release deep-held stress or emotional protection mechanisms.
- **Energetic Impact**: By releasing the chest and deepening the backbend, energy flows more freely through the governing vessel (Du Mai) along the spine, while the conception vessel (Ren Mai) distributes this energy into important organs of the chest. Energetically, Urdhva Dhanurasana helps practitioners release emotional blockages stored in the heart center, creating an emotional "opening" that aligns with physical expansion in the chest.
  
#### **Key Benefits:**
- Activate emotional release while promoting circulation and detoxification.
- Balance physical strength (yang) with emotional flexibility (yin).

### **Pranayama (Breath Control) and Energetic Flow**

A key aspect of proper meridian activation during asana practice is **Pranayama**, the art of breath control. In the context of meridians, breath serves as a conduit for Qi, transforming physical postures into energetic movements.

- **Ujjayi Breath**: This controlled, ocean-like breath generates internal heat, stimulating the yang energy of the body. When paired with dynamic postures, it channels Qi upward through the spine and along the governing meridian.
  
- **Exhalation and Yin Stability**: Longer, passive exhalations utilized in deeper, reflective forward bends like **Supta Kurmasana** (Sleeping Tortoise Pose) help stimulate the yin meridians, allowing a grounding and calming of mental energy.

### **Tai Chi Integration: Flowing Between Poses**

Tai Chi, a discipline known for its slow, controlled movements and focus on internal energy, serves as an excellent complement to Ashtanga Yoga. Tai Chi emphasizes smooth transitions between postures, ensuring a continuous flow of energy. By applying Tai Chi’s principles of flow and balance to Ashtanga, practitioners can maintain an uninterrupted flow of Qi through the meridians during the transitions between poses, rather than limiting the flow to static postures. This helps preserve the integrity of the meridian channels and fosters both spinal health and energetic balance.

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Balancing Yin and Yang**: Ashtanga’s progression from Primary Series (yang) to Advanced Series (deep yin) mirrors the Six Stages of TCM and provides a framework for addressing both physical and energetic imbalances.
  
- **Meridian Activation**: Each posture in Ashtanga directly correlates to specific meridian pathways, and understanding this connection can help enhance the flow of Qi, improving both physical well-being and emotional health.
  
- **Pranayama**: Breathwork is essential to activate and balance the meridian system. Ujjayi breath stimulates yang energy, while slower exhalations and breath retention bring stability to yin energy.

- **Tai Chi’s Flow**: Incorporating Tai Chi-like flow into your Ashtanga transitions enhances the continuity of energy and increases both spinal flexibility and strength by keeping the meridians open and flowing smoothly.

The combination of Ashtanga Yoga and the meridian flow principles of TCM offers a powerful union, enabling practitioners to move beyond the physical, building both energetic and emotional health. By learning to balance the structural integrity of yang with the flexibility and depth of yin, not only will your spine become stronger, but your entire system will align for optimal health and balance both inside and out.
