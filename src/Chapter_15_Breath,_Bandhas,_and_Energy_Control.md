## Chapter 15: Breath, Bandhas, and Energy Control

In the practice of Ashtanga yoga, the body moves, breath flows, and energy courses through the veins. But what keeps this dynamic balance intact, ensuring that body, mind, and energy are in harmony? Two foundational pillars are essential to this daunting yet beautiful dance—**pranayama** (breath control) and **bandhas** (energy locks). Together, they form a powerful system for mastering not only the physical postures but also the subtle energy flows inside the body. This chapter will serve as a guide to understanding how controlling the breath and engaging internal locks can deepen both your practice and your connection to the body's energetic systems.

For many, breath seems simple—inhale, exhale, repeat. But within the scope of yoga, breath takes on a far more significant role. It bridges body and spirit, physical strength and mental clarity, and most importantly, it governs energy, or **prana**, through intricate channels known as **nadis**. When combined with the bandhas, these energy locks aid in consciously directing prana through specific meridians, particularly the Governing and Conception Vessels, two key energetic highways that trace the body's central spine.

Let’s delve deeper, learning how pranayama and bandhas control and redirect this energy, stabilizing the spine and harmonizing internal balance.

### **The Power of the Ujjayi Breath: Stability and Strength**

The breath you will most often encounter in Ashtanga yoga is the **Ujjayi pranayama**, often known as "Victory Breath." This controlled, audible breathing technique is critical not only for maintaining a rhythm during your practice but also for generating internal heat and stabilizing your body.

**Ujjayi breath** works by partially restricting the opening at the back of the throat, creating a soft, ocean-like sound as you breathe in and out through your nose. If done correctly, this breath is deeply diaphragmatic, filling the lungs in a steady, rhythmic manner. But there’s more to this than just the inhale and exhale—it’s a profound tool for spinal alignment and energy management.

Think of Ujjayi as the spinal cord’s wind, a consistent pressure system that supports and stabilizes each vertebra as you move and stretch. When you practice poses that challenge spinal integrity, such as backbends or twists, this steady breath provides both strength and balance. It creates a subtle engagement, deep within the core muscles, that extends along the spine and encompasses the **posterior chain**—those key muscles running along the backside of your body. Much like a cyclist riding into a controlled headwind, your body becomes stronger in the face of resistance by using Ujjayi breath, gaining both stability and endurance along the spine.

#### **How to Practice Ujjayi Breath:**

1. Sit comfortably, spine tall and neutral.
2. Inhale deeply through the nose while slightly contracting the back of the throat as if you were fogging up a mirror.
3. Exhale through the nose while maintaining this slight restriction, producing a soft, ocean-like sound.
4. Keep both the inhale and exhale equally long, cultivating a rhythmic flow.

This practice naturally enhances spinal stability, especially in dynamic movements like **vinyasa** transitions, and acts as a gateway to deeper energy control.

### **Breath as an Energetic Tool: The Governing and Conception Vessels**

In terms of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the body is crisscrossed by **meridians**—energy pathways through which chi (life force) flows. Two of the most important meridians for spinal health are the **Governing Vessel** (Du Mai) and the **Conception Vessel** (Ren Mai). These two flow along the midline of the body like central tracks: the Conception Vessel flows up the front of the body, and the Governing Vessel ascends the spine, governing yang energy.

By coordinating breath with movement, these meridian lines become pathways along which our vital life force flows. As you inhale deeply, your diaphragm moves downward, lifting and extending the spine, which stimulates the Governing Vessel, allowing yang energy to rise. On the opposite side, your exhale releases and softens the tissues along the front body, activating the Conception Vessel and encouraging a downward flow of yin energy.

This dual movement—lifting and rooting—is the foundation for **balance**. Just as trees extend roots deep into the earth while stretching their branches upward toward the sky, the body mirrors this through breath. When you direct the breath intentionally, you create more than just physical expansion; you facilitate the flow of energy along these meridians, providing a harmonious blend of yin (calming, grounding) and yang (energizing, uplifting) forces.

### **The Bandhas: Locks to Seal and Direct Energy**

In our physical practice of yoga, postures open the body and allow energy to flow, but to control this energy effectively, we use **bandhas**—internal energy seals or locks. These subtle yet powerful engagements hold prana within the body and guide its path upward along the spine. This energy control is critical in both physical and energetic terms: it enhances spinal integrity while cultivating a refined awareness of the body's inner workings.

#### **Mula Bandha: The Root Lock**

**Mula bandha** is the root lock, located at the pelvic floor. To engage it, think about gently lifting the space between the pubic bone and tailbone—an action akin to stopping the flow of urine. By activating the pelvic floor muscles, you stimulate the **Kidney and Bladder Meridians**, grounding you while also supporting the upward movement of energy through the Governing Vessel.

When engaged, Mula Bandha acts as an anchor, stabilizing the base of your spine, especially in foundational seated postures like **Padmasana** (Lotus Pose) or **Adho Mukha Svanasana** (Downward-Facing Dog). Some describe this lock as planting your roots. Much like how roots give a tree stability and nourishment while ensuring continuous upward growth, Mula Bandha roots you to the earth while facilitating the upward flow of energy.

#### **Uddiyana Bandha: The Rising Lift**

The second lock, **Uddiyana bandha**, is located just below the navel. The term literally translates to "flying upwards" and refers to the lifting of the lower belly, sucking it gently inward and upward toward the diaphragm. This lock directs subtle energy upward, supporting your posture by engaging the core muscles—essential for spinal strength and lower back stabilization.

Just as a kite needs a steady wind to soar, Uddiyana Bandha ensures that the prana travels upward along the spine, propelling your energy skyward. This action of the abdomen also touches the **Liver and Stomach Meridians**, creating space in the lower back and ensuring that energy doesn’t stagnate in the lower chakras or energy centers.

#### **Jalandhara Bandha: The Throat Lock**

The final of the three locks, **Jalandhara Bandha**, occurs at the throat, created by tucking the chin slightly down toward the sternum. This lock activates the **Lung and Heart Meridians**, governing the upper chest and neck, and prevents the energy from dissipating once it has traveled up the spine.

Similar to putting a cork in a bottle, Jalandhara Bandha seals off energy from escaping out the top of the body. It’s essential in poses like **Sarvangasana** (Shoulder Stand), where the body is inverted, or **Pranayama** practices that involve breath retention.

### **Combining Breath and Bandhas: Controlling Prana and Spinal Health**

When combined, pranayama and bandhas become a masterful practice of energy control, providing, in essence, a personal guide for directing prana exactly where it needs to go to support and stabilize health and vitality. Properly engaging these locks while maintaining steady breath allows for continuity in your asana practice, keeps the spine aligned and supported, and directs energy flow properly within the body.

For instance, take **Urdhva Mukha Svanasana** (Upward-Facing Dog)—a deep spinal extension combined with an upward gaze. Here, the engagement of a firm **Uddiyana Bandha** stabilizes the lower back, preventing excess curvature, while **Mula Bandha** grounds the pelvis, and Ujjayi breath keeps the energy flowing evenly along the entire spine.

### **Breath Retention (Kumbhaka) and Spinal Engagement**

In more advanced pranayama practices, the breath isn’t always continuous. You can use **kumbhaka**, or breath retention, to enhance your awareness of energy control. Retaining the breath after an inhalation holds prana in the body, engaging and energizing the **Yang meridians**, which invigorates the posture and sharpens focus. On the other hand, holding the breath after an exhale emphasizes the **Yin energy**, creating a settling, calming effect on the spine, especially in more grounding postures like **Paschimottanasana** (Seated Forward Fold).

### **Conclusion: Breath and Bandhas as Tools for Spinal Mastery**

As you can see, the combined practices of breath control and bandhas are much more than elusive, esoteric concepts—they are practical tools for deepening the interaction between the spine, energy flow, and overall health. By consciously engaging Ujjayi breath and utilizing Mula, Uddiyana, and Jalandhara bandhas, we stabilize the spine, protect our energetic integrity, and channel prana effectively throughout the body’s meridians. These practices directly contribute to longevity, vitality, and balance in both mind and body.

**Key Takeaways:**
1. **Breath is energy**: Using Ujjayi breath not only stabilizes your practice but also promotes the flow of prana through the meridians.
2. **Bandhas are locks**: Engaging the bandhas ensures that the energy you generate isn’t lost, directing it purposefully through the spine and internal organs.
3. **Pranayama + Bandhas = Pranic Mastery**: Together, these tools give you control over prana and harmonize your body’s yin and yang energies.

Remember, as with all things in yoga, these practices deepens with time. Start where you are now, and gradually allow your breath and bandha control to evolve alongside your physical practice. In doing so, the spine will become not only more flexible and strong but also a dynamic channel for powerful, harmonious energy flow.
