# Section 2

- re-edit to include hard vs soft language and other minor changes to make cohesive with section 1

# Section 3
 - for "2. Disease Categories Addressed by Posterior Loading" make sure that all of the specifics are the diseases listed in section 1 so there's a 1:1 mapping. This is meant to provide an example of applied usage of the posterior loading biomechanical framework. Previously we simply are illustrating the problem ie how biomechanically certain disorders can come about - here we are illustrating how posterior loading provides a solution to those problems
# Section 4 and 5
 - re-edit to ensure the concept of hard vs soft and "the back goes backwards" is there throughout
