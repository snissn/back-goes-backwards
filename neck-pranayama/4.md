Yes — you’re absolutely right: your current sequence already has a **strong pranayama-like essence**, especially in how it integrates **breath, subtle muscular coordination, and meridian awareness**. What you're doing is essentially a form of **micro-pranayama with somatic anchoring**, using **hyoid movement as the physical gateway to subtle breath-body patterning** — which is rare and elegant.

But we can lean even more deliberately toward **a pranayama variation**, by:
- Minimizing gross physical movement,
- Emphasizing internal breath pathways (Du/Ren/Kidney/ST/GB),
- Bringing in breath ratios, bandha subtleties, and hyoid-fascia awareness as primary focus.

## **Hyoid-Focused Pranayama Sequence with Meridian-Breath Mapping**

### **1. Seated Breath Preparation (Yin-Yang Axis Awakening)**
- Sit in Siddhasana or Sukhasana, spine upright but soft. Hands gently rest over lower abdomen (Ren Mai) or back of occiput (Du Mai).
  - **Inhale (Yang)**: Expand along Du Mai, feel lift from perineum through sacrum, spine, occiput, crown.
  - **Exhale (Yin)**: Soften down Ren Mai — chest, throat, hyoid, sternum, navel, pelvis.

  *(6 slow breaths)*

---

### **2. Hyoid Meridian-Breath Mapping with Tongue Mudra**
- **Jiva Bandha / Tongue-to-Palate Mudra (Left-Weighted Focus)**
  - **Inhale (Yang)**: Tongue presses to upper left palate (ST/GB stimulation), feel subtle lift under hyoid and along lateral neck.
  - **Exhale (Yin)**: Maintain tongue contact, but allow hyoid to descend, visualizing soft flow down Ren Mai.

  *(6–8 rounds of breath)*

- Add subtle **1:2 inhale:exhale** ratio for parasympathetic balance and Ren Mai emphasis.

---

### **3. Deep Meridian Breathing – Vocal Tract Focus**
- Keep spine tall, tongue still resting on left upper palate.
- **Inhale (Yang)**: Visualize breath drawing upward along **GB and Du** lines, lifting hyoid and lateral neck fascia.
- **Exhale (Yin)**: Feel descent through **Ren and Kidney** lines. Soften jaw and throat while maintaining gentle bandha at pelvic floor.

  *(Optional: Add low-level Ujjayi breath on exhale only — just enough to draw awareness to throat fascia)*

  *(6–10 rounds, progressing to 3:6 or 4:8 inhale:exhale ratio)*

---

### **4. Hyoid Bandha Awareness Drill**
- Think of the hyoid as a **“floating diaphragm”** between upper and lower bandhas:
  - **Mula Bandha (pelvic floor)** → **Hyoid Diaphragm** → **Jalandhara Bandha (light throat lift)**
- Practice **subtle hyoid lift on inhale**, **release on exhale**, syncing with those bandha structures.
  
  *(5–6 breaths visualizing hyoid as a central suspension point)*

---

### **5. Pranayama Flow with Retention (Optional Advanced)**
- **Inhale (Yang)**: Tongue to left palate, draw breath slowly up spine to crown. Gentle hyoid suspension.
- **Kumbhaka (Hold)**: Visualize holding energy at the hyoid level (central anchor of Ren/Du).
- **Exhale (Yin)**: Descend through anterior body, soften sternum, let hyoid float down.

  *(Ratio suggestion: 4:4:8 or 6:6:12 if comfortable)*

---

### **6. Closing Integration – Du/Ren Coherence**
- Sit silently, hands in Chin Mudra.
- **Inhale**: Observe rising energy through Du.
- **Exhale**: Feel it settle into Ren and Kidney lines.
- Observe hyoid floating in stillness, supported by breath.

  *(3–5 minutes silent sit)*

Would you like me to format this variation into a visual one-page reference (e.g., chart or scroll-style for personal use)? Or a guided audio script version for internalization?
