Absolutely — we can extend this into a **complete long-form hyoid-centered pranayama sequence** that remains richly somatic, deeply breath-integrated, and rooted in TCM meridian dynamics. I’ll build it out in **9 structured phases**, each lasting 3–7 minutes if practiced slowly, for a full session of ~30–60 minutes. You’ll notice increasing internalization and subtlety across phases.

## **Extended Hyoid Meridian Pranayama Sequence (Left-Side Healing Emphasis)**

### **Phase 1. Meridian Orientation & Breath Sensitization (Du + Ren)**
- Sit tall, rest fingers on **Kidney 1 (Yongquan)** points or lightly on lap.
- **Inhale (Yang)**: Visualize Du Mai rising up spine to crown.
- **Exhale (Yin)**: Descend breath through Ren Mai down front midline to perineum.
- Add **breath scanning**: On each breath, trace meridian lines like rivers.

  *(6–10 rounds)*

---

### **Phase 2. Tongue Mudra + Hyoid Breath Tracking**
- **Jiva Bandha**, tongue tip lightly to **left upper palate** (ST/GB stimulation).
- Add **left hand under jaw** to sense muscular tone changes under hyoid.
- **Inhale (Yang)**: Feel lateral lift through neck and crown.
- **Exhale (Yin)**: Visualize hyoid lowering, throat softening, Ren Mai flowing.

  *(1:2 ratio — e.g., 4 in, 8 out)*

---

### **Phase 3. Lateral Meridian Breath Expansion (ST/GB/SI Pathways)**
- Visualize breath rising along **Stomach, Gallbladder, and Small Intestine meridians** on the **left neck/jaw/shoulder lines**.
- Add gentle **neck lateral tilt left on inhale**, return to center on exhale.
- Optionally: Place left thumb on GB20, index finger at ST9, feel meridian bridge tension shift with breath.

  *(6–8 breath cycles + 2 mins silent observation)*

---

### **Phase 4. Hyoid Suspension & Soft Kumbhaka**
- **Inhale (Yang)**: Tongue to left palate, feel hyoid gently suspend upward.
- **Kumbhaka (Hold)**: Float awareness at hyoid — a still point between inhale-exhale, between Yin-Yang.
- **Exhale (Yin)**: Release hyoid downward, Ren Mai flows like a waterfall down front body.

  *(Progress to 4:4:8 or 6:6:12 ratio. 6–8 rounds)*

---

### **Phase 5. Yin Meridian Descent & Hyoid Integration (Ren + Kidney Pathways)**
- Visualize breath entering at crown, passing through **throat center/hyoid**, and continuing down Ren/Kidney meridians.
- Use **reverse abdominal breathing**:  
  - **Inhale**: Expand upward along spine (Yang).
  - **Exhale**: Contract belly, deepen descent (Yin, Kidney pull).
- Feel the hyoid as a bridge between chest and head, coordinating flow.

  *(Optional hand placement: right hand over sternum, left at low belly)*

---

### **Phase 6. SCM Release + Infrahyoid Relaxation**
- Visualize SCM as **blue (Yang)** cable that often overactivates. Exhale into it.
- Use **gentle jaw shaking** or **Lion’s Breath variant (Simhasana)**:
  - **Inhale**: Tongue to left palate, eyes upward, expand throat.
  - **Exhale**: Mouth open, tongue stretch out/down, sigh out tension in SCM/hyoid.
- Add humming or sighing to **vibrate hyoid fascia on exhale.**

  *(Repeat 4–6 cycles + silent breath afterward)*

---

### **Phase 7. Left-Side Meridian Breath Isolation**
- Now bias all breath awareness to **left-side meridian channels**:
  - **Inhale**: Visualize ST/GB/SI rising on left.
  - **Exhale**: Ren/Kidney descending on left.
- You may close the **right nostril** temporarily to accentuate this (Anuloma style, not Nadi Shodhana).

  *(5–7 rounds)*

---

### **Phase 8. Resonant Tone Breath**
- Add **sound vibration on exhale** to deepen fascial and meridian resonance:
  - Choose **"Mmm," "Nnn," or "Aaah"** — each resonates differently in **jaw, tongue, hyoid, chest**.
  - **Inhale (Yang)**: Silent, expansive.
  - **Exhale (Yin)**: Hum or tone slowly, feel where it vibrates (especially under hyoid or in Ren line).

  *(6–8 rounds, optional switch of tones to map resonance)*

---

### **Phase 9. Closing Stillness – Hyoid as Central Axis**
- Return to silent seated posture.
- Tongue floats gently to upper left palate, no tension.
- Visualize **breath orbit from Kidney → Spine (Du) → Crown → Hyoid → Ren → Kidney** — a full microcosmic orbit, with hyoid as the central diaphragm.
- Let breath become so subtle it *feels* like it’s originating at the hyoid.

  *(5–10 minutes, no counting — just spacious awareness)*
