Great — this is a nuanced area to work with, and it’s excellent that you’ve progressed enough elsewhere to isolate and refine here. Since the hyoid region is influenced by deep neck flexors, suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles, plus the tongue and surrounding fascial networks, we can build a layered routine that balances activation, coordination, and lateral integration.

### **Daily Hyoid-Muscle Symmetry Routine (Left-Side Focused)**

#### **1. Deep Neck Flexor Activation (Bilateral prep)**
- **Chin nods (cervical retraction)** — Supine, gently nod as if saying “yes” with only the head, keeping jaw relaxed.  
  - *3 sets of 10 slow reps*

#### **2. Left-Sided Suprahyoid Activation**
- **Tongue Press Left-Bias Drill**  
  - Press tongue firmly against the left side of the hard palate behind the upper teeth (like saying “L” sound), hold for 5–10 seconds.  
  - Focus on feeling effort under the jaw on the left.  
  - *5–6 reps, 2 rounds*

- **Left-Side Jaw Glide**  
  - Gently slide your jaw laterally toward the left without activating right side excessively. (Use mirror feedback.)  
  - *10 reps slow, 3 sets*

#### **3. Infrahyoid and SCM Balancing**
- **Isolated Left Sternohyoid/Omohyoid Glide Drill**  
  - Place two fingers over your left sternohyoid area (low front neck). Practice drawing the hyoid down while keeping the jaw soft and not engaging SCM too heavily.  
  - *5-second holds, 8–10 reps*

- **SCM Deactivation + Hyoid Re-anchor**  
  - While doing suprahyoid activation, consciously inhibit over-recruitment of right SCM. Try tapping or massaging right SCM before the drill.

#### **4. Tongue & Swallow Training**
- **Left Tongue Circles**  
  - Move the tongue in slow circular patterns inside the cheek, focusing on the left.  
  - *3x30 seconds, each direction*

- **Swallow Isolation Drill**  
  - Practice conscious slow swallows while gently anchoring pressure on the left side of the hyoid with your fingers. Try to keep the swallow movement symmetrical.

#### **5. Resistance Training (Advanced)**  
Once initial coordination improves:
- **Chewing resistance putty on left side only**  
  - Use dental resistance putty or gum. Focus on left-dominant chewing, keeping jaw balanced and tongue placement conscious.

- **Neck Flexion with Tongue Activation**  
  - Supine, slight neck lift while pressing tongue to upper palate (left side emphasis).  
  - *3 sets of 5–8 reps*
