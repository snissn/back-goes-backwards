Perfect — here’s a **refined, breath-integrated movement sequence** centered on **hyoid coordination, TCM meridian activation, and postural symmetry restoration**, with a clear **inhale (Yang)** / **exhale (Yin)** structure. This can be practiced as a standalone daily ritual or layered into a broader somatic routine.

  - **Inhale (Yang)**: Press tongue firmly to upper left palate, feel lift at left geniohyoid/mylohyoid.
  - **Exhale (Yin)**: Soften tongue downward, feel energy descend Ren line down throat to chest.

  *(6 rounds, optional finger contact on left hyoid to feel engagement)*

- **Lateral Jaw Glide – Stomach Meridian Cue**
  - **Inhale (Yang)**: Glide jaw left, visualizing energy flow through ST meridian (lateral cheek, neck).

### **5. Tongue Orbit Drill – Shao Yang Meridian Tuning**
- **Tongue Circles (left-side bias)**
